1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 breaking news out of San Francisco as US Marines make their way through the city trying to capture an

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:14,040
 Elusive target and then we take a look at the story of a babysitter who has a close encounter of the delicious kind

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,920
 And then we visit Ohio University

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,240
 Considered one of the most haunted colleges in America

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,760
 Are these hauntings caused by a past of suicides and murders or is it something even more?

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,640
 Today on Dead Rabbit radio

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:44,320

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,800
 But before you guys destroy your entire life, let's go ahead and welcome our newest patreon supporter. He is a vehicle himself

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,440
 There's a bunch of little kids hanging out of his window

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,800
 He's like I don't have kids. It's Thomas the dink engine

13
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,280
 Everyone give a round of applause to Thomas the dink engine is all these little kids are like help us

14
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:18,040
 Help us. We're trapped in this interdimensional train. Tom. We laugh. We laugh at the children's plight

15
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,040
 Thomas you're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode you guys can't support the patreon

16
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,280
 Or if you have kidnapped children from across the dimensions, that's fine too. Just helps rid the word about the show

17
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,760
 Really really helps out a lot. Thomas. I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit dirgeable

18
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:38,120
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit command. We are headed out to the city of san francisco

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:44,600
 Came across the story the other day. I'm sure you guys saw it in the mainstream news

20
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,080
 Who am I kidding the mainstream news more like the mainstream lube

21
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,480
 Concerns that's what they should be called right? I got this from the real news

22
00:01:53,480 --> 00:02:01,240
 The news that doesn't need to be prepared the news that has no sanitary conditions whatsoever real raw news

23
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,400
 It's may 3rd 2021 go go go go go go bunch of marines are running through the streets of san francisco

24
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,600
 There's a bunch of mucking taking place. We don't have time to stop that

25
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,560
 We don't have time to actually maintain law and order in the lawless city of san francisco. No

26
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,800
 We have one target in mind go go go. They're doing the hand signals game fingers are shooting them. They think they're from a rival gang

27
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,640
 Ah, the marines are making their way through the city of san francisco target

28
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,600
 house speaker nancy polosi

29
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:35,400
 She if you're part of the 95 percent of the world population who cares nothing about us politics

30
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:43,400
 She is currently the house speaker. That's why that's her name. She's the speaker of the house of representatives in the united states congress

31
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,440
 and she's wanted for

32
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,680
 unspecified crimes

33
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,360
 Apparently she's committed several crimes the article did not make it clear

34
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,600
 It went into great detail about who was in charge of this operation

35
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,320
 But did not really make clear to me what nancy polosi is being charged with but anyways the us marines that are still under the control

36
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,560
 of president trump

37
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,960
 Trump still president joe biden not president. He's at like a sound stage

38
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,840
 It's like a fake white house that's in the same location of the white house

39
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,240
 The sound stage is actually in the white house. So when you see his car is driving around

40
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,000
 He's just going to the sound stage. He's not actually going to the oval office

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,520
 this is the slightly lopsided office where he's at and

42
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:32,360
 The us marines are looking for house speaker nancy polosi. Go go go go go. She's like 78 by the way

43
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,240
 I don't know what he even said that a full platoon

44
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,280
 It's not like she's gonna go straight up tony montana and start like shooting them up with a bunch of cocaine or will she

45
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,720
 We'll find out the us marines are moving through the city. Go go go go go

46
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,920
 And they see her they actually plan to this operation. They waited till her husband was at work

47
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,760
 Because if there's one if you think there's gonna be complications taking down one 70 year old person

48
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,600
 You don't want to face two of them. So they wait till her husband's at work

49
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:06,680
 They see house speaker nancy polosi leaving her house the marines throw a bag over her head zip tie her throw her into a van

50
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,200
 Go go go. They told the marines have sent this entire operation

51
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,960
 They can't say any word other than go go go. They have to say three times in a row as this van is speeding away

52
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,960
 Duly elected house speaker nancy polosi is in the back of this van that's speeding out of the city of san francisco

53
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,680
 They take the bag off of her and they realize something

54
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,640
 Go go go one of the marines says and the other one goes go go go. It turns out

55
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,640
 That they did not nab nancy polosi. They nabbed

56
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,360
 a decoy

57
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,720
 This was a another woman a much younger woman

58
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,200
 Who was wearing a realistic

59
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,800
 realistic nancy polosi mask

60
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,320
 And also had like her passport her id

61
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,920
 Everything on her that detail didn't

62
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:03,800
 Have any sense but that detail specifically didn't make sense if she has a life like nancy polosi mask on

63
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,040
 What does she need her passport and her driver's license license for right?

64
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,360
 And if she has nancy polosi's passport and driver's license, what does the real nancy polosi have?

65
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,680
 Does she have the doppelganger?

66
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,120
 Does she have the person with like photos of the person without the mask on?

67
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,240
 Why would you give doesn't make sense? You wouldn't want your decoy to flee the country

68
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,360
 You wouldn't want to make sure they didn't have a passport anyways

69
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,320
 turns out that nancy polosi

70
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,280
 who

71
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:39,880
 Regularly works in washington dc all the time and is well known in san francisco where she was elected

72
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,360
 They can't find her. They can't find her even though she's on television all the time

73
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,440
 Very very well known schedule where this woman's at they can't find her

74
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:54,760
 And this is i wanted to read you this quote from this article because i just love this stuff. I just love this stuff quote

75
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:01,320
 us military assets have fudged a covert mission to apprehend house speaker nancy polosi

76
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,520
 Arresting instead a polosi doppelganger

77
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:11,960
 Donning a lifelike mask that mimicked every hideous detail of polosi's face

78
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,720
 Right down to the most deeply ingrained wrinkles

79
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
 unquote

80
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,000
 I don't think the marines put that in their interaction report. They're like like dear dear general

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,760
 We thought we got nancy polosi because no one would like this. She doesn't look that ugly

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,600
 Nancy polosi is an elderly woman. She's not so

83
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,120
 Yes, if I was describing if I held him a mask of nancy polosi, I wouldn't say

84
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,720
 Every hideous detail. She's an elderly woman. It's not just that nancy polosi

85
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,960
 Has a doppelganger with a mask, but it's a disgusting mask

86
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,280
 The author wants to let us know that this mask was super hideous

87
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,280
 But anyways, who am I? I'm not a real journalist the people at real raw news

88
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,560
 Know how to undercook the facts and give them to us raw. So who am I to judge?

89
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,400
 This isn't a beauty podcast. This isn't a special effects podcast

90
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,680
 And this definitely is not a real raw news podcast

91
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:15,080
 So semper fi gentlemen your mission in san francisco is halfway complete. You capture nancy polosi's

92
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,640
 face

93
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,200
 Thomas the dankenjun, let's go ahead and leave behind san francisco

94
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,440
 I'm gonna toss you the keys to the jason jalopy. We are headed out to

95
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,160
 Fort Wayne, indiana

96
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:36,600
 Seeing a train drive a car is not something I thought we would ever see but here we are. Thomas the dankenjun is somehow making it work

97
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:43,080
 It's a long driver. Smelling is exhaust the whole time. We're like, uh, he's a coal burning engine. We're all passing out

98
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,200
 Eventually though, we're taking a fort Wayne, indiana hospital

99
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,840
 We are revived from carbon monoxide poisoning and it is time to start this story

100
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:56,120
 It's march 1993 and there's a young woman. Let's call her

101
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:04,200
 Let's call her nancy. Let's call her nancy. There's a young woman named nancy. She is babysitting a baby a little baby person

102
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,800
 Parents are gone. Nancy is taking care of this kid

103
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,080
 Rainstorm starts

104
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:22,600
 But she's an experienced babysitter the rain doesn't super scare her right. It's just something that happens from time to time

105
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,000
 But then the power goes out

106
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,400
 Rainstorm power outage. You're alone with the baby now things are getting a little nervous and the baby starts screaming

107
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:41,560
 She's trying to figure out what to do like this is a strange house where are the candles?

108
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,160
 Where's the flashlight got the screen don't want to trip on the baby. Where's the baby?

109
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:51,080
 While she's trying to figure that out a bright light shines from outside the house

110
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,280
 The entire house is illuminated now

111
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,880
 But it's not a comforting light. It's a mysterious spooky light. It shouldn't be there

112
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,320
 And then

113
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,240
 There's a knock at the door

114
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,240
 Nancy slowly turns her head. I don't know. He might have turned it super fast. That wasn't in the notes

115
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,160
 It didn't say how fast she turned her head Nancy ever so slowly looks towards the door

116
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,360
 She sees the doorknob turn

117
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,000
 Then the door opens

118
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,080
 And she sees

119
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,160
 in the darkness

120
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,960
 A four foot tall man

121
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,680
 He's purple

122
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,840
 Her eyes must have really adjusted at this point to determine that he's purple

123
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
 with a curved nose

124
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,800
 large ears

125
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,120
 And he stands there looking at her for a second

126
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,000
 Nancy is frozen

127
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,080
 Little man staring

128
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,080
 Nancy's staring

129
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,580
 And the little man runs into the house

130
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,960
 Passed Nancy passed the baby into the kitchen

131
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,040
 She sees the refrigerator door open up

132
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,400
 That one's also a haunted refrigerator door

133
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:41,400
 Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

134
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,320
 They got it from Strange Magazine number 13 Strange Magazine has served us very well in the past as well

135
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,680
 So think about it docks.com has a really good

136
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,560
 Track record as far as legit stories in Strange Magazine 13 the one time we covered it

137
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,080
 We covered it twice one was I think a monster in a basement

138
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,040
 The other one was the puff balls that rock people's skin

139
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,520
 I'll try to find those two stories for the show notes. I'll try to put those episodes in the show notes

140
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,160
 But this is an interesting story for me

141
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,200
 Because it makes this is a Pepsi commercial, right? Like when when

142
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,760
 I'm pretty sure there is a I'll actually try to see if I can find on youtube

143
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,640
 I'm pretty sure there's a soda commercial with this same setup

144
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:29,960
 Or a Snickers commercial butterfingers or something like that. I know the Reese's pieces had the alien but this seems set up

145
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,640
 This story seems fake

146
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,320
 This story seems fake and that's why I want to cover it

147
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,040
 At what point

148
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,960
 Do we dismiss stuff out of hand? I'm not going to go on a huge tangent with this

149
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,880
 But at what point when you hear a UFO story or an alien story do you go? That's not true

150
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,360
 And this is an interesting one for me because on the one on a

151
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,360
 If you never if he had not walked in to get the soda

152
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,480
 It would just be a babysitter meets an alien story

153
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,840
 It would actually have been so mundane. I wouldn't have covered it

154
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:11,240
 Because we see stuff like this happen all the time the fact that it goes in and gets a soda doesn't say the brand of soda

155
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,760
 So it's not the best advertisement in the advertising the alien's hand is covering the soda the whole way. You're like, is that coke?

156
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,760
 Is that Pepsi? I don't know what to buy

157
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,120
 At what point do we dismiss alien stories or really any of these stories imagine a story

158
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,200
 Where a ghost walks into a house and turns to the camera and goes choice of a new generation

159
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,720
 You're like, what?

160
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,400
 What what is that ghost story have an advertisement in it at what point do we decide to dismiss these things?

161
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,760
 I'm not saying the story is fake. I'm saying I highly doubt that it's real

162
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,880
 Because it reminds me of a commercial and is that fair

163
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:55,080
 For me to say because her story. I mean, I would think that this young woman saw

164
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,480
 A commercial like this and then she dreamt about it or was imagining it

165
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,960
 But I am dismissing the story because it reminds me of a commercial

166
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,600
 I feel like

167
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,280
 The story is not true because it seems so ridiculous, but we've covered a lot of ridiculous stuff on this

168
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,600
 So, I mean the story is kind of meta for me

169
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,680
 The cassa blanca invasion is one of the most ridiculous alien stories. We've ever covered. I'll put that in the show notes

170
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,960
 But any reminder remind me of a commercial

171
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,560
 So I just want I want to include the story one because I think it's an interesting but two on that meta level at what point

172
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,440
 Do we decide this is too ridiculous for us to believe because in essence all

173
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:44,040
 Alien things all ghost stories all bigfoot stories are too ridiculous for 70 to 90 of the population to believe

174
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,520
 So I just think it's interesting when we come across stories. Otherwise, this is fairly legit

175
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,160
 It's from two sources that I've gotten good stuff from before

176
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,440
 I distrust this I can't even say I distrusted like again

177
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:00,280
 I'm in that weird mode, but I wanted to cover this because of that meta moment and for you guys to examine that as well

178
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,200
 At what point do you go? I don't believe that because it's too

179
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,080
 It's too wacky

180
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,440
 It's interesting because we do come across that even though at its core everything is wacky and it's possible

181
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,800
 That the story is so wacky that it is true

182
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,720
 It's super bizarre and I think it would be hoove aliens to do more wacky and weird stuff

183
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:28,840
 They really want to stay off people's radar the weirder they get like making people pancakes or having talking bears show up

184
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:34,440
 Which are both stories we've covered on this show the less likely people are to believe them

185
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,200
 So it actually makes sense of aliens did things that mimicked pop culture

186
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,680
 Like the next files episode where the men in black were jesse ventura and alex trebek

187
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,980
 Because they knew no one would believe that they were visited by jesse ventura and alex trebek

188
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,560
 The aliens actually plan to be that ridiculous

189
00:14:53,560 --> 00:15:00,360
 Thomas the dinkage and let's raid this babysitter's fridge and take all the sodas. We're gonna leave her. We're gonna say goodbye to the baby

190
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,840
 Hopefully they'll be okay. Hopefully no more aliens show up, but it's really doesn't matter to us

191
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,240
 We have another story to cover. I'm gonna touch you the keys of the carpenter copter. We're leaving behind

192
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,200
 This little house in fort Wayne, indiana. We're headed out to afton's ohio

193
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:24,200
 We've actually been to ohio university before I covered it a long time ago on episode

194
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,760
 200 what was it episode

195
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,000
 276

196
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,600
 Because at ohio university part of the college campus used to be an insane asylum

197
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,840
 As the campus was they built the campus and then 70 years later

198
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,840
 They thought it'd be a great idea to build an insane asylum right next to it

199
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,240
 And not a good idea. Not a good idea, right? It's gonna definitely interfere with your grades if you're afraid some lunatics

200
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,920
 Going to break in at any moment

201
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,920
 Eventually the asylum was shut down and the campus absorbed it

202
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,960
 So the campus got bigger and now the asylum is some classrooms and some teachers offices

203
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:05,400
 But we covered the ridges in ohio university back on episode 276

204
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,360
 But I started looking at some other ghostly activity that brought me back to

205
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,840
 Ohio university that I wanted to take a look at with you guys. So we're now college students. We're walking around campus

206
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,760
 We got on our college clothes. Those are different the regular clothes. They're smarter

207
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:28,280
 We're walking around ohio university, which is the alma mater of not only richardine anderson a k a magyver

208
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,040
 But ed o'neill

209
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,520
 Everyone's favorite television dad no matter what generation you're in you have good memories of ed o'neill

210
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:39,000
 Richard Dean Anderson and ed o'neill we wave hi to them. They're like, dude, we don't go here anymore

211
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,400
 We graduated decades ago. We're like see you in class. They're like, what are you guys even talking about?

212
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,520
 We're gonna take a little tour of this supposedly haunted college

213
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:52,600
 So you have east green so it's divided up into sections. So first off, let's start off on the section

214
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,400
 Oh, and is east green. There's a place called wilson hall

215
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,400
 That's where we're going to be dormant with our buddies. I don't need Richard Dean Anderson

216
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:05,560
 They're like, dude, we don't go here anymore. We're like, let's be bunkmates. They're like, oh man, they're stuck in this story now

217
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,400
 We go to get our dorm room. It's room 428

218
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,120
 But it's boarded up

219
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,600
 We're like, what how are we supposed to get in here and the hall monitor or whatever they're called the

220
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,120
 chauffeur, what are those guys called the hall monitor?

221
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:27,000
 The floor dude the floor dude walks up and we're like a floor dude. He's like, dude, I'm called the din mother

222
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,440
 What are they called the people who run the dormitories the mayor? He goes, hey guys

223
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,880
 I know you guys supposed to be in room 428, but that one's actually even sealed off

224
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,000
 We don't let anyone in that room anymore and we go. What's what happened there? He goes, let me tell you a story

225
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,080
 Also, sorry for sorry for booking you in a room that doesn't exist anymore

226
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,680
 But let me tell you a story

227
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:51,160
 This room used to just be a normal dorm room and back in the 1970s. There was a student

228
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,320
 Let's just call him Barry. We don't have his name

229
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,920
 But he was in there

230
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:01,000
 Fun loving guy probably the description of him whatsoever. They just says a man in the 1970s

231
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,240
 So he could have been could have been anyone. It could have been Henry Kissinger. It could have been

232
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,320
 Ed O'Neill. We don't know probably wasn't either of them. They didn't die

233
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,040
 mysteriously room 428

234
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,480
 But a young man died in room 428 that was in the 1970s

235
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,640
 Everyone in Wilson Hall had heard this story and some people. Oh, did he commit suicide?

236
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,320
 Well, maybe was he murdered? No, they don't think he was murdered. He just died mysteriously and this story went around

237
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,440
 But people went in and out of this room through the semesters through the years other people use this room

238
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,640
 Didn't really have a problem with it

239
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,120
 But a couple years later there was a girl who had heard about these stories

240
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,440
 And heard about this guy who died mysteriously and she was really into

241
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,960
 Black magic astral projection talking to spirits stuff like that

242
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,920
 She's in that room and she goes, you know, this is perfect because since this guy died mysteriously here

243
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,360
 This would be a vortex for me to make my powers greater

244
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:03,560
 People are like, what are you talking about you weirdo? So she begins to talk about astral projection

245
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,600
 She's trying to harness the power of this room and then she dies

246
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:14,760
 Supposedly some say that she killed herself by slitting her own wrists

247
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,040
 Other people say well her wrists were slit

248
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,760
 But she didn't do it

249
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,520
 She was murdered not by an assailant well technically an assailant but not by a human assailant

250
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,160
 But the dark forces came after her

251
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,200
 She was brutally murdered

252
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:39,080
 Because she was pushing the limits of what a human should know what a human should be capable of when it comes to the world of the paranormal

253
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:46,200
 So now the room had an even darker reputation. You had two people who died there one mysterious circumstances the other one

254
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:52,760
 May or may not have committed suicide, but definitely was involved in some dark arts black magic things like that

255
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:58,200
 Time marches forward. This is a dorm room students are filtering in and out of the college

256
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,720
 People are still using the room

257
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:05,320
 But what they're starting to run into is that when students would come in they'd put down their keys or their coffee cup or whatever

258
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:11,240
 You had reports of things being thrown off of shelves smashing against walls smashing into the floor

259
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,800
 Doors would open and close by themselves

260
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,760
 Sometimes you'd be in the room all by yourself

261
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:24,360
 Sometimes you'd be in the room by yourself and you'd hear a loud shout which i'm not going to emulate that

262
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,320
 Just imagine this voice but way louder right in your ear

263
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:33,320
 And then on the door people said that they could see the outline of demonic faces in the woodgrain

264
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,920
 That is the one I call the most bs on anything because that could easily be what is it periabola

265
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,880
 Where you're just looking at patterns and you're seeing it wrong and stuff like that

266
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,480
 But everything else could definitely be possible when we talk about the world of paranormal even the faces appearing on the door

267
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:53,240
 But I couldn't find any photographs of that the 1970s people had cameras if this is something that was happening all the time

268
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,920
 It'd be easy to document. I'm not saying there's not photographs out there. I couldn't find any

269
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:02,440
 Eventually the university got so many reports of paranormal activity in the room. They just sealed the room off

270
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:08,680
 We've covered that before we've talked about another university this episode is going to be full of past episodes of the show notes

271
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:14,120
 We talked about another university before I don't remember where I think it was actually now that I remember it was in

272
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,920
 Athens, but it was a different university where they also had walled up a room

273
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,120
 There's a staircase that leads to nothing. It's walled in

274
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,240
 There's a lot of legends behind that and so we have this same thing you have this room this dorm room

275
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,960
 That is not accessible. I was actually watching a video by the post. I believe it's called

276
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,560
 It is a Ohio University newspaper. It's their journalism program

277
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,040
 And they were investigating it. I mean, they were kind of goofing on it as well

278
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,040
 But they showed the door the door does exist

279
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:51,880
 You can't enter it. So it actually is a real place that can't be entered. It's not an urban legend

280
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,880
 It's not like room 428 doesn't exist at all. Even to this day on campus. They hear these stories about this room

281
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,760
 this building is also

282
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,680
 apparently in the middle of a pentagram of

283
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,400
 Native American cemeteries. So some people think that's why Wilson Hall is haunted but looking into Ohio University. That's not all

284
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,240
 Jefferson Hall, which is another building on campus

285
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,960
 Has what's called the marble sound. This would be weird to pin down

286
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,120
 They say sometimes when you're walking around Jefferson Hall, you're on the top story

287
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:31,160
 It sounds like someone's dropping thousands of marbles on the roof. There's nobody up there

288
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,040
 If you go to Washington Hall

289
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,000
 There is an entire this is huge actually. There's an entire ghost

290
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,280
 There's an entire ghost basketball team

291
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:49,400
 A high school girls basketball team all of them. It's an entire girls basketball team haunts, washington hall

292
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,640
 The story goes

293
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,200
 There was a girls high school basketball team. They visited

294
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,040
 Campus, they're like, oh, this place is great. I can't wait to go to college here

295
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,000
 I'll probably be here forever and ever and ever

296
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,040
 I'll see that at the same time even the coach is all ever and ever and the tour guides like oh, that's creepy

297
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,760
 and then they died in a car accident on the way home

298
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:15,560
 And now instead of their ghost going back to their loved ones instead of their ghost inhabiting the places

299
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,880
 They grew up and no they're just all at washington hall a place they visited once

300
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,200
 Which means i'm never going to go to a sucky plan

301
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,280
 I'm never going to go visit a sewage treatment plant

302
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,440
 Well, all this place is kind of cool and then my ghost then I died like eight years later

303
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,480
 My ghost is floating around a sewage treatment plant. I'm like, oh it sucks

304
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,280
 So that's the backstory

305
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:39,480
 But this okay, so if you heard that backstory you're like, oh, that's kind of sad, but you know

306
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,800
 They're in washington washington hall first. There's no basketball court there. It's apparently like a dormitory

307
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:52,120
 So it's not like they're like, oh, we can always play b-ball and who would they play against they're playing against a bunch of demons

308
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,680
 They're trapped in washington hall these girls are trapped in this dormitory

309
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:03,640
 That whole backstory is created because sometimes when you're in washington hall you hear the sound of basketball dribbling

310
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,680
 So here's what i'm gonna tell i'm gonna tell you what happened i'm telling you what happened

311
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:15,880
 Sometimes you can hear a basketball dribble in washington hall i'll give them that it probably is a phantom basketball dribbling

312
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,560
 I think the high school basketball team is made up because i actually heard several versions of this story one is

313
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:28,760
 You just hear the basketballs the second one is it was a men's basketball team an adult men's basketball team that was trapped there

314
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,360
 And then the story that I found was the most fascinating and sad

315
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,720
 Was the all high school girls visiting one single time and being trapped there

316
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,240
 So I think what happens is there and this is very common in ghost stories

317
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,400
 There is a singular ghost event that may happen once or twice

318
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:51,720
 It may happen on a regular occurrence and the backstory is made up and I actually think that leads us into the answer of 4 28

319
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,800
 Most likely the room is sealed off for one reason or another

320
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,760
 Apparently the official answer is it's not safe

321
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:04,600
 That could mean anything from asbestos black mold the foundation's giving out

322
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,200
 There's a bunch of nails the place is infested with cockroaches

323
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,320
 It could be all sorts of things now most of those would affect the rest of the school

324
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,320
 It's not like they just nail a door shut and they're like cockroaches you'll be in there forever

325
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,960
 Could also be that it wasn't safe because you got a couple students complaining about

326
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,720
 Doors opening and closing there could have been a paranormal thing there

327
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:29,800
 But I think the story is made up from the 70s about the younger those are probably made up

328
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,720
 They're probably

329
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,040
 Backtracked they probably have a story wise. Why can no one go in this room?

330
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:41,320
 Someone goes. Oh, it's just not safe and then people over the years have made up these myths

331
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,320
 And that's the most logical answer

332
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,960
 But I don't want to end with the most logical answer

333
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,800
 Let's put on our conspiracy caps here because I found something really cool about this university

334
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,440
 That opens it up to a whole other

335
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,480
 set of theories

336
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,080
 This school

337
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,400
 Has one of the most powerful

338
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:06,440
 Particle accelerators on the planet that's capable of sending a particle up to 14 of the speed of light

339
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,520
 It's one of the most powerful on the planet

340
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:14,440
 It was opened in 1967 which predates

341
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,640
 The ghost story of wilson hall the man who died mysteriously

342
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:26,040
 So with our conspiracy caps on it would be interesting to think that this particle accelerator

343
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,440
 Which is used for all of these experiments

344
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,080
 What if it actually has opened a rift of some sort?

345
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,960
 and so we do have

346
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:42,840
 More ghost act because this by a lot of accounts. This is I've just covered the ghost in this particular like wilson hall

347
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,520
 Washington hall

348
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,960
 There's a ton of ghost stories in this college. It's considered one of the most haunted colleges in the united states

349
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,120
 It's one of the oldest colleges in the united states

350
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:59,960
 But what if this you have this normal ghost activity people walking up and downstairs stories being shoved this particle accelerator has actually opened up

351
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:06,040
 Some sort of gateway that allows this phenomenon to be more apparent

352
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,800
 To be so apparent it can actually be violent and actually kill people

353
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,480
 So that's an interesting way to look at it. You have science and the paranormal blending together

354
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,320
 The side effect of this particle accelerator is causing that but then I thought of something even crazier

355
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,080
 and

356
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:28,280
 And I am not I am not implying I'm not implying in any sort of legal sense

357
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:33,480
 That ohio university or the people who maintain the particle accelerator

358
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,720
 Or this is conspiracy cap fully on do not sue me

359
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,400
 What if the experiments of the particle accelerator is what killed those two kids?

360
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,840
 Somehow a little particle

361
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,160
 A little particle was flying around so fast and it went crazy

362
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:57,640
 Grabbed a little particle knife a little did a little particle Ted bunny. What if by some sort of fluke

363
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,840
 That particle accelerator killed the kid in 428

364
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,400
 You're like Jason

365
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,480
 That's not how particle accelerators work conspiracy cap fully on

366
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:17,320
 What if the particle accelerator killed the kid in 428 in the 70s? So after it was operated some guys are like let's do this

367
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:25,640
 Let's see what happens. Let's type in particle plus 14 speed of light plus

368
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,400
 Charles Manson like what are you doing? Don't type that in

369
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,280
 The thing starts up. What I'm saying is what if that's why the room is not safe

370
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,280
 It's like right in the right in the path

371
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:45,160
 Like people are disintegrating at 14 of the speed of light that young woman in there

372
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,880
 She really is trying to do black magic, but it's not working. She's trying to astrally project. It's not working

373
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,720
 And then one day she's sitting there. She's walking around the house and she feels something but doesn't feel it

374
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,120
 and she looks down

375
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,360
 and

376
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,840
 A particle

377
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,920
 A particle hit her wrists a particle like she was she was holding a bag

378
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,720
 She was holding a big piece of bread

379
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,680
 She was walking with a piece of bread and she had her hands out

380
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:24,760
 And the beam the little particle went and cut across both of her wrists and it cut it so deep that she dropped a baguette and

381
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:31,320
 She died and so it didn't look like they're like no one would ever kill themselves if they were about to eat a giant baguette

382
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,520
 What happened? What if the particle accelerator is the reason why this room is unsafe?

383
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:45,240
 It's probably more it's probably more likely my original theory the particle accelerator may have something to do with ghostly activity in the area

384
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,120
 but

385
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:54,200
 Since we're already going down that path. I thought what if the particle accelerator is actually killing people there

386
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,760
 So does this particle accelerator open up gateways to other worlds as a few particle?

387
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,840
 have

388
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,520
 A few particles gone rogue and murdered students

389
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,640
 Who knows we don't know right it could be neither of those it could just be a particle accelerator

390
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,280
 A bunch of kids telling ghost stories making stuff up

391
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:20,040
 But the answer to these stories lie locked away behind the door to 428

392
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:26,120
 Maybe the school's right. Maybe it's not safe to go in there, but you try your luck anyways

393
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:33,160
 You want to prove the existence of ghosts you want to disprove the new conspiracy theory about murderous particles

394
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,720
 So you are able to sneak in

395
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:41,000
 You're in there for a bit waiting for something to happen asking the spirits to show themselves

396
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,120
 It's been 20 30 minutes

397
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,600
 You know you should leave because eventually the school authorities are going to find out you're in there

398
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,240
 And as you go to reach for the doorknob

399
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,200
 You realize

400
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
 It's wet

401
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,120
 It's sticky

402
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,120
 And it's warm

403
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:07,080
 That's when you look down and you see your own blood

404
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,880
 dribbling off of your fingertips

405
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,440
 onto the stained carpet

406
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:18,760
 You thought you were going to prove the existence of ghosts and you were right

407
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,360
 You became part of the story

408
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:29,960
 For decades students will tell the tale of a ghost investigator who forced their way into room 428

409
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:36,760
 And by the time anyone realized they were in there, they had been dead for days

410
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:42,760
 Their ghost now wanders the campus

411
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:50,440
 Hoping no one else makes the same mistake of walking into room 428

412
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:58,920
