1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580
 When a young boy is visited by a beautiful alien woman, he's about to learn the movie

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,980
 was right.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,380
 Earth girls are easy.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,880
 And then for a long time I have talked on this show about my theory that the government

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:20,060
 of the United States is investigating the world of ghosts and demons.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,060
 It turns out, I'm half right.

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,060
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:36,260
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,060
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,060
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,060
 Hope you guys are staying warm.

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,560
 It's so cold in here.

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,560
 I'm wearing socks in the house.

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,560
 I feel like a barbarian.

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,220
 I usually just walk around barefoot.

16
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,340
 And now my feet, my feet are cold.

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,780
 Man, this sucks dude.

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,400
 Come on, spring show up.

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,060
 Someone who always shows up on time walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one

20
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,220
 of our Thanksgiving live stream supporters.

21
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,420
 Give it up for Black Dragon 232.

22
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,420
 Woo!

23
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,920
 Black Dragon's all walking in.

24
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,140
 Sounds like a Yu-Gi-Oh card.

25
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,900
 Black Dragon, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

26
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,500
 You guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

27
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,340
 Just helps read the word about the show.

28
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,180
 That also really, really helps out a lot.

29
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,180
 Now Black Dragon, we should just ride you honestly.

30
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,600
 We should just climb on your back and you can fly us around.

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,640
 But Black Dragon, let's go ahead and tashi the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,280
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

33
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,960
 We're going to float all the way out to Mobile, Alabama.

34
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,800
 Mobile, Alabama.

35
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,440
 We're in the late 70s, the mid 70s, the timeline of the story's a little off.

36
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:52,260
 But we're about to take a look at a man who believes that aliens gave him the ability

37
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,380
 to seduce any woman alive.

38
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,900
 And dead if he's into that sickness.

39
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,420
 There's this guy, he didn't give his name.

40
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,980
 We're going to call him Michael.

41
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,260
 Michael is a young boy, probably like 6'7".

42
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,300
 He starts suffering from sleep paralysis.

43
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,460
 So that sucks, right?

44
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,600
 You're laying there and then you wake up and you can't move your body.

45
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,520
 That kind of makes sense, right?

46
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,680
 In the words there, sleep paralysis.

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,240
 And it's what a lot of people think causes alien abductions.

48
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,480
 Not that they see you can't move and the alien's like, "Here's the perfect time."

49
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,440
 But there's a lot of skeptics who say that sleep paralysis, you can't move.

50
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,560
 Your brain's still dreaming.

51
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,720
 You start imagining the hag or a demon or a gray alien and things like that.

52
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,220
 So this guy would suffer from that.

53
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,300
 A lot of people do suffer from sleep paralysis.

54
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,900
 But when he wasn't busy sleeping and being paralyzed, he was drawn to light.

55
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,060
 So Michael would always like to look at the light.

56
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:55,180
 So he would see like a flashy neon light down the street and he's like, "Yay, say oh woo!"

57
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,180
 And he's like shot.

58
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,740
 There at least doesn't go into the shop to buy anything.

59
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,860
 He just stands out looking at the lights.

60
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,780
 You think I'm exaggerating?

61
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,300
 Well he tells this own story that he would often stare at light bulbs for long amounts

62
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,300
 of time.

63
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,640
 He would just sit there staring at a light bulb.

64
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,240
 Sounds like a wonderful person to bring to a party.

65
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,840
 One day Michael is standing there staring at a light bulb and his eyes are wide open.

66
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,360
 I didn't say that he made that noise.

67
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,280
 I didn't say that he was a zombie.

68
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:31,160
 But he stood there with his eyes wide open looking at this light bulb and a fly is flying

69
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:39,180
 around the room.

70
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,180
 He liked the special effect.

71
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,500
 I was moving my head the whole time.

72
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,460
 Flies buzzing around in surround sound.

73
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,460
 And remember this guy has his eyes wide open.

74
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,460
 Okay?

75
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:54,580
 And what I'm about to tell you is not the most ridiculous part of this story, at least

76
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,180
 according to him.

77
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,100
 But I can't figure out how this happened.

78
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:08,760
 Because when you say "I'm staring at my eyes" do you think your eyes are actually opened?

79
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,240
 And you're like "Jason, where are you going with this?

80
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
 Where are you going with this?"

81
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,840
 Like if I open my eyes wide and I'm staring right at you I'm uncomfortably close nose to

82
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,760
 nose with you and I'm staring.

83
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,840
 Would you call my eyes wide open and you say "Yeah of course."

84
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,960
 "What are you talking about and get out of my personal space?"

85
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,260
 "Yeah my eyelids are open."

86
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,460
 But could this happen?

87
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,100
 Can you guys tell me any world and we deal with the world of the paranormal, demonic

88
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,740
 gateways and such.

89
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:42,740
 He said he's staring at a light bulb for so long and his eyes are wide open.

90
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,660
 A fly flew and hit his eyeball.

91
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:55,020
 And before he could do anything the fly crawled behind the back of his eyeball and now there

92
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,320
 was a fly stuck in his head.

93
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:07,080
 I've read stories about bigfoot wearing pants chasing Amish farmers around that I found

94
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,200
 10 times more believable than this.

95
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,720
 Now listen there might be some sort of medical thing where your eyeballs are smaller than

96
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,440
 the eye sockets.

97
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
 Maybe?

98
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,280
 There could have been a tiny fly?

99
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,240
 I don't know.

100
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:26,620
 But the fly flew and hit his eyeball and then crawled over his eyeball and is behind his

101
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,620
 eyeball now.

102
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,260
 Like inside of his skull.

103
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,340
 I think?

104
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,820
 He just says the fly hit him and flew in the back.

105
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,380
 I'm adding, I'm trying to add realism to saying that it crawled across his eyeball because

106
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:44,420
 I don't think if you threw a fly at somebody's eyeball or if it just happened to fly in it

107
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,700
 wouldn't go behind your eye.

108
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,700
 Am I wrong?

109
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,080
 I think a normal thing.

110
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,720
 He has this fly, everyone shut off the podcast early dude.

111
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,600
 This is way too disturbing.

112
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:55,600
 This guy has this fly behind his eyeball now and he feels a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

113
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:25,600
 This guy has this fly behind his eyeball now and he feels a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

114
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:50,340
 in

115
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:55,780
 and he's meditating.

116
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:05,100
 And all of a sudden a beautiful woman materializes in his room.

117
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:15,060
 He describes her as Caucasian with long blonde hair and he can't see her hands or her feet.

118
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,620
 He doesn't say if they're blurry.

119
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,340
 He doesn't say if she has her hands behind her back and she's standing in two shoe boxes.

120
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,980
 But he can't tell what her hands or her feet look like.

121
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,260
 Everything else looks good to go right?

122
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,100
 Beautiful blonde woman.

123
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,260
 Now this story is super disturbing.

124
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,620
 I'm sorry Black Dragon.

125
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,740
 He's telling this story.

126
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:42,380
 He told this story to Mufon which is a massive, it's a mutual UFO network.

127
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,220
 They're really big in this community.

128
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,620
 He told the story to them.

129
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,580
 They obviously take this seriously.

130
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:53,220
 10 year old boy, beautiful woman, no feet, no hands.

131
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,780
 And he starts to develop these really intense sexual feelings for her.

132
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,340
 Oh gross bro, you're 10.

133
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,220
 And her, don't materialize in a 10 year old's bedroom.

134
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,880
 As he's walking towards her, he wants to give her a smooch right?

135
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,620
 She disappears.

136
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,420
 April 5th 1981, we're gonna jump ahead a couple years.

137
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,420
 Actually when does this take place?

138
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,540
 I don't know when the first part takes place.

139
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,540
 But anyways on April 5th 1981, maybe it's the next day, maybe it's a couple years later.

140
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,660
 Maybe he's a legal adult when she shows up.

141
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,660
 We don't know.

142
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,660
 Because she reappears.

143
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,940
 Again, no hands, no feet are invisible.

144
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,900
 And they have sex this time.

145
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:40,740
 So I'm really hoping she showed up and she's like, "Oh, I'm 8 years too early."

146
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,220
 But now she's back and it's on.

147
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,220
 They're banging.

148
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,180
 Dude, I don't know when this happened.

149
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,740
 I don't know how old he was.

150
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,740
 So just imagine he's an 18 year old guy.

151
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,260
 Because I honestly don't know.

152
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,380
 That's the only way my brain can tell this story.

153
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,220
 Because otherwise it's super creepy.

154
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,180
 It's interesting to think, sorry I have to go off in a segway, just to kind of cleanse

155
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,300
 the ballot.

156
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,260
 We always see aliens, this is fascinating, now think about this.

157
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:14,220
 We always see aliens abducting human women and impregnating them.

158
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,340
 We've had quite a few stories where the aliens are taking women and forcefully putting babies

159
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,980
 in them and then harvesting the babies out.

160
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,300
 That's kind of a trope of alien abduction.

161
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,860
 I wonder how, this is fascinating, I never thought about this before.

162
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:39,140
 How many stories are there of young girls, sorry this is black track and flew away.

163
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,220
 He's setting my claws up on fire trying to stop the podcast.

164
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:49,580
 How many stories are out there of girls who you would illegal, right?

165
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,860
 The aliens don't care about our laws, but you know what I mean?

166
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,020
 We have these stories, usually they're women in their 20s.

167
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:02,660
 Most of the stories that I've uncovered, they're women in their 20s.

168
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,580
 So I wonder if this happens at a younger age.

169
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,140
 Weird, I do not want to type it into Google.

170
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:18,820
 But yeah, it's interesting because obviously those laws are set up for a reason and I'm

171
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,300
 pro age of consent laws, but that would mean nothing to an alien.

172
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,060
 An alien who's 300 years old, a woman in her 20s is like a toddler to them.

173
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,220
 It's like a zygote.

174
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,660
 So yeah, that's interesting and disturbing.

175
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,900
 I wonder though, it has to happen.

176
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,740
 And if it doesn't, then there's a reason for that.

177
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:47,940
 If the aliens are picking women in their 20s, they must view that as the prime candidate

178
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,140
 for a hybrid child.

179
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,620
 Maybe even though a younger woman, I can't even believe I'm talking about this, even

180
00:10:53,620 --> 00:11:00,180
 though a person under the age of 18 can get pregnant, maybe the aliens, I don't think

181
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,100
 there would be some sort of rule or law against it, right?

182
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,940
 Even when we talk about stories of the reptilians, like the reptilians, kidnapping kids, they're

183
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,580
 usually eating them and then they impregnate the women, like the legal women.

184
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:19,340
 This is actually, dude, this is kind of blowing my mind right now because either one, most

185
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:24,680
 of these stories are made up and people don't want to get arrested for writing creepy stuff

186
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,920
 about kids.

187
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,060
 So when they're making this stuff up, they're using adult ages.

188
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:35,460
 I don't think that's the case, but just putting it out there too, this is happening to girls

189
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,260
 under the age of 18.

190
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:44,580
 Some boys in this story, but thinking about the idea of alien breeding, they are doing

191
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,020
 it to girls under the age of 18 and we don't know about it.

192
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,140
 Or, that means like there may be a couple of stories out there, like they're just not

193
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,100
 coming to mind, or I've never found them.

194
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,580
 Or the aliens have left that age group alone for whatever reason.

195
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,740
 I mean, it'd be a good one.

196
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,580
 I would support it, but would it be because the aliens are like, "Uh, that's super gross."

197
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,780
 Would it be that maybe even though they can physically have human kids, they're not ready

198
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,980
 to have alien hybrid kids?

199
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,420
 Could it be that, like, is it a sense of morality?

200
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,940
 Like we don't want to do this to really a child, mentally a child, but again, like,

201
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,940
 that's weird.

202
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,220
 I never thought about that.

203
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,220
 Never thought about that.

204
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,580
 Anyways, now we're talking about it on our podcast and it'll cross my mind every once

205
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,580
 in a while.

206
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,580
 There has to be a reason for that.

207
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,580
 There has to be a reason.

208
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:42,740
 Again, either stories are made up and they don't want to write about pedophilia, or the

209
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:48,900
 aliens are doing it and we don't know about it, or the aliens are choosing not to do it.

210
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,460
 That opens the question of why.

211
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,460
 Fascinating.

212
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,940
 I love doing this podcast because I never would have sat down and talked out loud and

213
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,940
 worked that out.

214
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,260
 And for my remaining listeners, I hope you still enjoy this.

215
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,460
 Anyways, let's get back to the story of Michael.

216
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:10,900
 He has sex with this woman and he said the world explodes in blue flame.

217
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:16,460
 It's just like this passionate release of energy and then he wakes up.

218
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,900
 But to him, it wasn't a dream.

219
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,860
 Like he had this experience and then he did it.

220
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,780
 Then he smoked a cigarette, went to bed and then he woke up.

221
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,540
 He says quote in his report.

222
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,420
 He says quote gross.

223
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:33,940
 But he says quote before this I was a child, after this I was sexually aware.

224
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:42,860
 And what happens is after that moment, after April 5th, 1981, women begin throwing themselves.

225
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,100
 I really hope this guy's legal otherwise.

226
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
 Oh my goodness.

227
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,620
 I don't even know why he releases them so soon.

228
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,220
 Women begin throwing themselves at him.

229
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,220
 Oh Michael.

230
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,220
 And he's like walking down the street.

231
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,700
 Totally an adult.

232
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,220
 He's going to go register to vote and he's signing up for selective service.

233
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,500
 They're like oh Michael and no matter where he went, women fell in love with him.

234
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,660
 He became a sex god.

235
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,100
 Now what's interesting is that should be the end of the story.

236
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,540
 Just a little tip from a tale teller like myself.

237
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,540
 In strong.

238
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,980
 When you're going to tell a story that should be it.

239
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,980
 You walk into a room and all the women automatically want to have sex with you.

240
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,180
 But he then goes on to tell a story that he joined the Navy which is ridiculous because

241
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:33,500
 if you had the ability to seduce any woman, I would just be seducing senators and stuff

242
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
 like that.

243
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,380
 They'd be going to the house of representatives and be like what's up gals and everyone's

244
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,180
 like woo and they're like all over me and they're like we're going to pass a law making

245
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,740
 Jason Carpenter the best guy ever and pay him money.

246
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,220
 And people would be like what?

247
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,220
 That's insane.

248
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,220
 Who is this guy?

249
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,540
 This guy's the sort of Lex Luthor super villain?

250
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,180
 And then I would go on tour and I'd be like be walking around shopping malls and I'm

251
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,620
 like hey ladies vote for that Bill.

252
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,940
 Hey yeah you do and they'd be all falling in love with me and I would get a million dollars

253
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,940
 a month.

254
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,020
 That's put in the noggin of use right?

255
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,700
 He joins the Navy.

256
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,980
 He basically wants to sit on a boat full of dudes.

257
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,900
 Actually maybe he got tired of women constantly pawning him.

258
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,540
 1981 they had nothing but men sailors.

259
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,060
 He goes on a boat in the middle of nowhere and actually nothing about it that probably

260
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:25,380
 is what you would do after years of being harassed, harangued, grabbed by women.

261
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:30,900
 I mean it's cool for the first couple years but he gets on a boat full of weapons in the

262
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,700
 middle of the ocean that's staffed by nothing but men.

263
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,740
 But while he's there he has an issue with his foot.

264
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:45,500
 And so apparently the doctors are doing this x-ray and they look and there is a, a, a

265
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,100
 needle in his foot.

266
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,260
 Now he says it's a implant, an alien implant.

267
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,700
 The doctors he said were being really cagey about it.

268
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,860
 They didn't really want to reveal what it was but they said it was a sewing needle.

269
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,580
 He must have stepped on a sewing needle as a kid and it went all the way up into his

270
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:08,700
 foot and so you couldn't see it anymore and he didn't know it so they were able to pull

271
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,540
 at some of it but they go part of it broke.

272
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,100
 We can't get the whole sewing needle and he's like ahhh and he goes I think it's an implant.

273
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,420
 I don't think they were telling me the truth.

274
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,820
 What's the chances of me stepping on a sewing needle and not remembering it?

275
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,100
 Like stepping on a sewing needle so hard it went all the way up into my foot.

276
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,100
 What are the chances of that?

277
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,580
 And what are the chances of a sewing needle breaking apart?

278
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,460
 Kind of the point of a sewing needle is just like this hard piece of steel.

279
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:37,780
 I would tell Michael what are the chances of a fly crawling into your skull via your

280
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,980
 eyeball.

281
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:45,780
 But maybe he is not only lucky in love but lucky in stuff going into his body.

282
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,580
 So that's the story of Michael.

283
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,620
 I mean Mufon, I found it on ThinkAboutItDucks.com.

284
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,020
 They're a totally legit website.

285
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,460
 We've been covering them for a long time.

286
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,460
 Great website.

287
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,900
 It's a great afternoon reading.

288
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,820
 I just recommend going there and looking around.

289
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,300
 They got it from Mufon which again is a national UFO research group.

290
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,100
 I mean dude, does that mean we have to believe this story?

291
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,060
 I believe this guy told it.

292
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,580
 I believe that this guy told it.

293
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:16,500
 What's interesting is if you just took the last two parts, the sex god and the needle,

294
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,580
 I'd probably be a little more like oh that's possible.

295
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:25,300
 Because I believe in alien implants and I guess I believe that someone could have an

296
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:31,940
 aphrodisiac ability given if you can be telekinetic or if you can have telepathy or if you can

297
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,500
 talk to ghosts like a medium.

298
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:40,300
 Why wouldn't you be able to affect the vibrational core of other people, i.e. women?

299
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,500
 I wonder if he was gay if it would affect dudes or if he's just out of luck.

300
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,220
 He's like oh great.

301
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,140
 Yeah, interesting story.

302
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:53,020
 The part with the eye, the fly flying into the eyeball, it makes it a little sus.

303
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:58,300
 But I mean again, I get a bunch of emails from you guys in photos and video demonstrations

304
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,780
 of you pushing flies into your own eyeball.

305
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,460
 Maybe that's super possible.

306
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,940
 I don't know but it's weird.

307
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,940
 That part when I was reading and I was laughing really hard and I thought it was disgusting.

308
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,300
 I couldn't wait to tell you guys it.

309
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,500
 But then I kept reading and it's a fascinating story.

310
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,060
 On the one hand, that would be a cool power to have, right?

311
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:23,620
 That women, again you want it to be fair specific, women want to have sex with you.

312
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,700
 Whatever it is, is 18 and up.

313
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,500
 I don't know how you would work the alien magic like that because I don't know.

314
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,660
 Like 18 and up, right?

315
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,820
 But yeah, I think it probably would get tiresome after a while.

316
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,220
 And then you're running, you're running, you can't run so far because you got a needle

317
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,340
 in your foot.

318
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,180
 Black Dragon 232, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the carboner copter.

319
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,540
 We're leaving behind Michael.

320
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:53,140
 We are headed all the way out to Alima, Peru.

321
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,940
 What did that story take place?

322
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,940
 What was it?

323
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,060
 I wonder if this dude is still alive.

324
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,060
 He didn't give his name.

325
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,100
 I suck on this first one.

326
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,740
 I know I got a transition to the next one, but he didn't give his name.

327
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,740
 I made up the name Michael.

328
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,740
 I wonder if this dude is still alive.

329
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,940
 What if it is like some lethario it's Channing Tatum or something like that?

330
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,940
 Who knows?

331
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,020
 One of the Jonas Brothers.

332
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,420
 All of the Jonas Brothers?

333
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,420
 Who knows?

334
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,740
 Anyways, Alima, Peru.

335
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:28,500
 We're at the intersection of Garcilaso, De La Vega and Espana Avenue.

336
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,100
 And at this place there is the Matucita house.

337
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,420
 It's a two story building.

338
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,900
 It's very, very nondescript.

339
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,740
 You could drive your car past this a hundred times and you wouldn't even know the building

340
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,740
 was there.

341
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,220
 You probably maybe after two or three times you'd realize the building was there.

342
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,740
 But you wouldn't even catch your eye.

343
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,540
 It's just a building.

344
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,980
 This area, if you want to talk about like a cursed area, this is a recipe for it.

345
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:01,620
 In pre-Hispanic times, before the conquistadors showed up, this area was used for religious

346
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,460
 ceremonies for the natives in the area.

347
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:10,820
 And after the conquistadors showed up, the old wall of Lima cut right through where this

348
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,020
 house is today.

349
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,060
 And that was the marker.

350
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:20,740
 It was a very, very physical marker that showed this is the side of the Spaniards.

351
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,700
 And on the other side, that's where the natives lived.

352
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,940
 That's where the slaves lived.

353
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,900
 So you have a location that has been powered by religious ceremonies over the course of

354
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,660
 decades, centuries maybe.

355
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,700
 And now there is a wall there that separates the population and it solidifies the fact

356
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,580
 we are your betters.

357
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,300
 You're on the other side of that wall.

358
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:48,260
 In 1860, in this location, a prison was built.

359
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,620
 And that prison was an operation until 1970 and it contained everyone from common crooks

360
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,420
 to military prisoners.

361
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,580
 And at one point, the president of the country was locked up in there.

362
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,780
 I don't think it was for a fun overnight stay.

363
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,660
 I'm pretty sure he was being charged with something.

364
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,100
 I don't think he was like, "Hey, I wonder what these prisoners are going through.

365
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,020
 I want to see what the people live like."

366
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,460
 The first floor of this building, totally fine.

367
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:18,260
 Now in modern times, on this city block, we have the map, Yusita house, a two-story building.

368
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,980
 And the first floor, totally fine.

369
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,100
 You can walk through it all day long.

370
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,140
 Now the second floor, haunted.

371
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:31,060
 People are experiencing just typical hauntings, voices, things moving, stuff like that.

372
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,700
 Very very by the book.

373
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,860
 But creepy enough that you don't want to work there.

374
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,580
 Your stapler is always missing.

375
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,020
 There's cold spots in the room.

376
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,020
 You're trying to make a business call.

377
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,340
 And there's a voice of the damned going, "Ugh!" right behind you.

378
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,900
 It's not a place you really want to work.

379
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,220
 And these stories were flying around just like the poltergeist above their heads.

380
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,620
 The second floor of the Matusita building is haunted.

381
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,620
 So of course people are going to come up with reasons for this activity.

382
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,940
 One of them, one of the stories was there was a Japanese man who lived in Peru.

383
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,740
 One day he was coming home from work and he found his wife cheating on him.

384
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,860
 Jason, didn't she just say this was an office building?

385
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,180
 Yeah, but it also was a house at some point, right?

386
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,740
 They tried turning it into an office building.

387
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,780
 But before that, he's coming home from work.

388
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,780
 He's working in one room.

389
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,780
 He opens the door.

390
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,780
 He's like, "Honey, I'm home."

391
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,340
 He's walking through this other door.

392
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,860
 No, this place used to be a house.

393
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,500
 He comes home, his wife is cheating on him and he stabs him both to death.

394
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,500
 Stab, stab, stab, stab.

395
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
 Kills him both.

396
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,780
 And then he's like, "Oh dude, I'm totally not going to be able to get away with this.

397
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,380
 Look at all this blood.

398
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,860
 Look at these bodies.

399
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,580
 I probably shouldn't have done any of this.

400
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,500
 I probably should have walked through the door and gone back to work."

401
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,420
 And he's like, "I'm not going to be able to get away with this.

402
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,420
 They're going to catch me.

403
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:50,420
 So I might as well just go the extra mile and in a weird leap of logic, I mean, I kind

404
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:55,260
 of get it because people are psychotic, he waits for his kids to come home.

405
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,900
 You're like, "I didn't know he had kids."

406
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,260
 Well, not for long.

407
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,420
 His kids come home and he butchers them too.

408
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:06,020
 A lot of times when people, and then he kills himself just because of some point I'm about

409
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,780
 to say, a lot of times when people do murder suicides, they'll kill their kids and people

410
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,780
 go, "What?"

411
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,260
 And then he jumped off the bridge and he threw both of his kids over the bridge as well.

412
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,260
 Why would he do that?

413
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,260
 The kids deserve to live.

414
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:21,620
 Generally, when someone's that desperate and that at the end, they think life is so horrible.

415
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,940
 I'm actually doing these kids a favor by throwing them off the bridge.

416
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,900
 It makes no sense to the rest of us, right?

417
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,820
 Or to the kids, but in that state, he goes, "Well, it's better off.

418
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,340
 I mean, these kids are just going to grow up and their whore wife is going to cheat on

419
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,340
 them too.

420
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,900
 So I might as well just chop them up too."

421
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,140
 Chop some up, chop some up, then kills himself.

422
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,300
 And you're being really, really rude about this.

423
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,660
 This seems to be an urban legend.

424
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,780
 I don't think this actually happened, right?

425
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:52,220
 So before I get all the hate mail, this probably didn't happen.

426
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:58,260
 There's another theory that this house, again, back when it was a house, it was owned by

427
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,260
 a real jerk.

428
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:04,700
 I mean, the first guy butchered his family, but this guy, ugh, you just want to punch

429
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,100
 this guy right in the kisser.

430
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,820
 It was owned by this jerk and he treated his servants really, really poorly.

431
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,740
 So one day they say, "You know what?

432
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,820
 We're so tired of this guy treating us like trash.

433
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,220
 I know what we'll do.

434
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,700
 Let's put powerful hallucinogens in his food."

435
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,300
 And actually he's having a party coming up.

436
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:26,740
 Let's put powerful hallucinogens in everyone's food, except for ours, except for the servants.

437
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,740
 We'll be fine.

438
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,740
 So they did that.

439
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,260
 They put hallucinogens in all this food and everyone's like, "This is the best food ever.

440
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,260
 Dude, look at this turkey leg."

441
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,500
 And look at this turkey leg.

442
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,180
 And look at this turkey leg.

443
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,780
 And the other guy's like, "Oh dude, marshmallow's all the best."

444
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,820
 And then dude's intestines are getting eaten out and he doesn't even feel it.

445
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,540
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm king of the world.

446
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,540
 I'm king of the world."

447
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,900
 Then there's like a girl walking around in circles and she's like eating her own fingers.

448
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,900
 Yum, yum, yum.

449
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,420
 I love Del Taco.

450
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,900
 And just they basically kill each other.

451
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,140
 They basically like go so insane from all these hallucinogens.

452
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,380
 Like I just imagine everyone thinks the other person is food and they're running around

453
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,460
 chasing like these roasted chickens running down the hallway.

454
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,460
 And they just all die.

455
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,080
 And it's this huge bloody massacre.

456
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,380
 And the servants are like, "Oh, this is not what we expected."

457
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:20,480
 We thought they would just be staring at their hands for four hours instead of eating their

458
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,480
 hands.

459
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,140
 And now they're staring at us.

460
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,140
 Huge massacre.

461
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,580
 The servants ran.

462
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,180
 They left the city.

463
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,180
 Never seen again.

464
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:32,300
 Except in the hallucinations of people doing hallucinogenic drugs.

465
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,180
 Again, we don't know if this story is true.

466
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,620
 I love that story, right?

467
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,540
 That sounds absolutely terrifying.

468
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:45,180
 I hate mind altering drugs because my grasp of reality is already so thin.

469
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:50,180
 Ghosts and goblins and all this stuff I have to deal with on a daily basis.

470
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,260
 So if someone's like, "Dude, this will let you see everything.

471
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,260
 It'll open the door."

472
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,260
 I'm good.

473
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,260
 I'm good.

474
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,220
 And the servants, when the doors of perception are open, I call it Tuesday night.

475
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,520
 So I love that story, though.

476
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,140
 So they're all eating each other and stuff like that.

477
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,180
 It doesn't specifically say that they're eating each other.

478
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,500
 It says that they killed each other.

479
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,020
 But again, I often get called out on all my cannibal episodes.

480
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,060
 Apparently, there is something there.

481
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,060
 But they're eating each other.

482
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,060
 No, they're not.

483
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,060
 They're just killing each other.

484
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,060
 But anyways.

485
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,540
 So they say, this is when the story gets super fascinating.

486
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,500
 If you've already been like, "Oh, Jason's talking about Urban Legends again," which I really

487
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,700
 have done a lot this season, but I really, really like them.

488
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,700
 We found some good ones.

489
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,700
 Jason's talking about Haunted House.

490
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,940
 This is where it gets interesting.

491
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:37,620
 And this is where we get to my conspiracy theory that I've talked about before.

492
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,340
 Okay?

493
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,340
 There is the...

494
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:45,700
 Today, they say that this house is so haunted that if you spend more than five minutes on

495
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:52,500
 the second floor of the building, you will see the dead standing before you.

496
00:26:52,500 --> 00:27:03,820
 You'll hear the screams, their last wails, before they were slaughtered.

497
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,500
 You'll even see a reenactment of the murders.

498
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,100
 So I go up and I see the Japanese guy.

499
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,780
 I'm like, "Oh, not this lame one.

500
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,060
 I wanted to see people eat each other."

501
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,100
 Apparently you'll see the reenactment of the murders.

502
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,340
 In the 1970s, the guy put this to the test.

503
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,340
 This is real.

504
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,140
 Humberto Vilchez Vera.

505
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,260
 Most of a show called...

506
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,020
 This has to be Translation Era, right?

507
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,620
 But the name of a show called Ghosts Have Fun.

508
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,580
 I mean, that is an awesome name for a television show.

509
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,780
 I actually should have been the name of my podcast.

510
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,260
 But Ghosts Have Fun.

511
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,180
 It's a great name, but I think it's a Translation Era.

512
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,700
 Humberto said, "You know what?

513
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,540
 I've heard this story is very, very popular in Peru.

514
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:49,700
 I will stay for seven days on the second floor of this house."

515
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,700
 That's pretty bold, right?

516
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,140
 I don't know if they brought in seven days worth of food or if they were going to throw

517
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,740
 it in with a crane.

518
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,260
 But seven days, that's a long time.

519
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,740
 He's only there for two hours, though.

520
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,180
 He ran out of the building screaming.

521
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,180
 Checked himself.

522
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,740
 I don't know if this happened in the same day.

523
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:10,820
 I think he ran out of the building screaming, went home for a bit, and then thought about

524
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,820
 it.

525
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:16,020
 But the way that I haven't written my notes, it says, "Stayed for two hours, ran away."

526
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,540
 The next line says, "Checked himself into an insane asylum."

527
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,420
 I just imagine him running out of the house.

528
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,420
 Ah, he's running past the camera crew.

529
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,940
 Ah, running in the street.

530
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,380
 Ah, and then he just runs in and then saying, "I'd like to check myself in, please."

531
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,700
 Anyways, he checked himself into an insane asylum.

532
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,060
 This news reporter, or not news reporter, the show is called Ghosts Have Fun.

533
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:42,140
 But anyways, this television host checked himself into an insane asylum.

534
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:47,020
 He stayed there for 13 months and then vanished.

535
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,980
 No one ever saw him again.

536
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,580
 But this is so fascinating.

537
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,500
 That actually happened.

538
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:00,260
 A couple years later, he wrote a book.

539
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:05,580
 This guy completely vanished after spending 13 months in an insane asylum.

540
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,540
 The spookiest amount of time to spend there.

541
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:13,300
 He wrote a book and he said in the book, "I was just kidding."

542
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,100
 Like I didn't actually, I did run out of the building.

543
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,100
 Like we saw you run out of the building and you're like, "Yeah, yeah."

544
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,260
 I ran out of the building but I didn't actually go to an insane asylum and I didn't disappear

545
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,260
 all this time.

546
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:28,300
 I just wanted higher ratings for my television show so I pulled that stunt.

547
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,300
 I'm thinking, "How?

548
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,300
 Wait, what?

549
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,300
 That this is real.

550
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,500
 This, this, this, everything else you can say is urban legend."

551
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,820
 This actually happened.

552
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:40,540
 How in the world are you going to get higher ratings for your show if part of your story

553
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:45,060
 is you mysteriously vanished?

554
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,980
 Did they get a new host for Ghost Have Fun?

555
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,980
 And they just had like an in-memorium episode for this guy?

556
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,060
 Because the host of the show, the producers of the show, had to know this guy was still

557
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,060
 alive, right?

558
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,300
 Because there would have been like insurance payouts and they would have to pay the insane

559
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,700
 asylum every month.

560
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,540
 What type of, that's like a balloon boy level plot.

561
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,460
 It's so overwrought.

562
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:11,940
 How in the world do you disappear forever and think more people are going to watch your

563
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,340
 show that stops being made because you've disappeared forever?

564
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,900
 And if you're not doing the show anymore, why do you care if the ratings are higher?

565
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,780
 Absolutely bizarre story.

566
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:29,020
 But that's not the end of this saga because here's the thing, I have talked about on this

567
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,940
 show quite a lot.

568
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:35,940
 That we know the government investigates the UFO phenomenon.

569
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,380
 100% we know the government does that.

570
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,940
 They have Senate hearings about it.

571
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:49,540
 We also know with 100% certainty that the CIA has tested psychokinesis, telekinesis, telepathy,

572
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,700
 remote viewing, right?

573
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,100
 All this psychic phenomenon, we know for a fact there have been declassified documents

574
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,380
 showing that the CIA was interested in this.

575
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:08,940
 And I've said, do the governments of the world, does the CIA work with the greater paranormal

576
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,940
 world?

577
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,860
 Do they study Bigfoot?

578
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,420
 Do they study Bigfoot?

579
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,780
 Do they study ghosts?

580
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,700
 Have they tried contacting demons?

581
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,860
 Sure they may work with a medium to try to find a body, right?

582
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,260
 The FBI will do that every so often.

583
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,340
 Our local police will do that every so often.

584
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:30,020
 But what about a demonologist because they believe that a demon's in a certain area and

585
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,220
 they want to take him out?

586
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,340
 Or they want to try to control him or they want to learn something from him?

587
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,820
 If the government is looking into the world of the UFO and they're looking into the world

588
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:42,660
 of mental phenomenon, I can't imagine a CIA agent going "Pfft, ghosts!

589
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,660
 That's dumb!"

590
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,140
 Because they do all this other stuff, right?

591
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,300
 They do all this other stuff.

592
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,260
 So I've always said that.

593
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:55,140
 And this story makes that theory half right.

594
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,660
 And this is nuts.

595
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,860
 This is absolutely nuts.

596
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,460
 I'm really happy we're ending the week on this.

597
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,980
 Because in the town, this makes so much sense.

598
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,300
 I can't believe that I didn't think about this.

599
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:16,140
 In the town of Lima, Peru, there is a conspiracy theory, to be fair, in the city about the

600
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,260
 Matucita house.

601
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:27,660
 In the 1940s, the United States built their US Embassy for Peru in this area.

602
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,140
 Actually, right across the street, apparently.

603
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,700
 And people who have lived in this area for a long, long time, remember how these stories

604
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,700
 are kind of generating.

605
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,340
 We had it be this area, and then you hear the story about the Japanese man killing his

606
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,580
 family or the guy attacking his servants.

607
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,540
 There's no proof of any of these stories, right?

608
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,780
 But these stories have taken hold.

609
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,620
 The fact that someone in the 1970s is making a television show about it, right?

610
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,260
 It's one of the most famous haunted buildings in Peru.

611
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,220
 The belief is, this is so interesting.

612
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,660
 I didn't, kind of mad at anything about this.

613
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,900
 Their locals believe that this place is not haunted.

614
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,100
 All of the evidences of hauntings are in your head.

615
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,300
 There is nothing wrong with this building.

616
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:14,740
 The reason why you think it's haunted is because the CIA did not want people on the second

617
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,980
 floor of that building.

618
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:21,460
 It gave them a clear line of sight into the US Embassy for Peru.

619
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:28,860
 So to prevent people from living up there or from working up there, it's possessed.

620
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:33,580
 Evil demons of murder victims, and there might be a murderer hiding in the bathroom with

621
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:39,940
 a pipe or a knife or a bunch of hallucinogens.

622
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,380
 That's so interesting.

623
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,220
 And it totally made me think.

624
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:50,900
 All of these haunted roads we cover, or this place out in the wilderness where there's

625
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,700
 ghosts and maybe if you go out there, maybe if you go out to Huntsheville, there's a man

626
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,020
 with a shotgun and used to be these little people there who will chop your legs off,

627
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,020
 100% CIA operations.

628
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,580
 I'm not saying the CIA had a bunch of little people chopping people's legs off.

629
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:14,620
 I'm saying if you wanted a clear path to move items down a road, whether that be assets,

630
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:19,460
 whether that be cocaine, because they did smuggle a bunch of cocaine into the United

631
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:24,060
 States and sell it as crack, I don't think they were driving through Huntsheville when

632
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,180
 that happened, but this makes sense.

633
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:32,180
 You could totally take an area off the map locally by saying this place is haunted.

634
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:37,460
 And you go, Jason, but the thing is, it's like you're always talking about, you know

635
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,900
 about these legends because kids are driving down this road and why would the CIA want

636
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,380
 Crybaby Bridge?

637
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:48,260
 If you had a road that was no or let's stay with House example, or I don't want to get

638
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:52,340
 too far into the weeds, the CIA is hiding there waiting for me.

639
00:34:52,340 --> 00:35:00,700
 If you had a house that you told people was haunted, you would attract a small amount of

640
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,460
 people going into that house.

641
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,180
 I've ghost hunted, I've done physical ghost hunting, and a lot of you may have done physical

642
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:12,980
 ghost hunting as well, gone to a location, investigated a haunting or rumored haunting,

643
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,900
 but the normal people don't do that, right?

644
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,140
 The silver bank executive is like, you know what, it's Friday night, let's drive down

645
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:24,060
 to the MacArthur Manor and see if the skin eating demon is true.

646
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,780
 Most people don't do that.

647
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:30,140
 You would reduce the foot traffic if you spread these stories.

648
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:33,580
 This makes so much sense.

649
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,940
 This makes so much sense.

650
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:40,220
 Now I'm not saying every haunting is CIA because that would be the end of the show, right?

651
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,500
 If from now on every ghost story I go, and the reason behind that ghost was the Central

652
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,940
 Intelligence Agency.

653
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:50,860
 No, but it will make, I would say there is a, I honestly believe this now, this is my

654
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,420
 conspiracy theory.

655
00:35:52,420 --> 00:36:00,380
 I believe there is a portion of haunted roads, haunted houses, haunted locations that are

656
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,300
 important to the CIA in one way or the other.

657
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,900
 Now right now the embassy is not near this location.

658
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,700
 The embassy has moved.

659
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,420
 It's still in Lima, but it's no longer on this street.

660
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:15,580
 The ghost stories persist and now Ghost Hunters can go up there all day long.

661
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,180
 Are they finding anything?

662
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:23,580
 They spread these, this is so fascinating, I love this.

663
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,660
 This makes sense.

664
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,900
 CIA may not be talking to ghosts, they may, I honestly still think they're doing that,

665
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,900
 right?

666
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,300
 I think the CIA would have because we figure other people are probably doing it, right?

667
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,060
 Other governments are probably doing it.

668
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:41,780
 Trying to investigate the world of paranormal, life after death, demonic entities, I totally

669
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,780
 believe that they probably still have a part of their budget going towards that.

670
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,140
 But this boots on the ground totally makes sense.

671
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:56,100
 You would want to keep prying eyes off of a certain road so you could drive three black

672
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:02,420
 sedans down it once every four or five months because that's the cleanest way to get from

673
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,580
 point A to point B.

674
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,500
 Now having these three black sedans moving down a highway, sure they may just blend in

675
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:15,020
 with everything else, but someone may notice.

676
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:21,660
 Covert ops requires you to be covert and if you say this road's haunted, a lot of people

677
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,660
 will avoid it.

678
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:28,340
 Some people will go there for it, but a lot of people will avoid it.

679
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,500
 And these roads tend to be like out in the middle of nowhere.

680
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,860
 I remember once when I was driving down Dyer Lane, we came across the police officer driving

681
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,940
 without his headlights on.

682
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,980
 Not just his siren lights, his headlights were off.

683
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,700
 That cop was up to something shady.

684
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,660
 He was probably up to no good, right?

685
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,660
 That would be the place to do it.

686
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,980
 I remember as we passed this cop, I thought this would be the perfect place if you're

687
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:54,900
 a dirty cop to make a drug drop off because nobody drove down Dyer Lane because everyone

688
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,180
 thought it was haunted.

689
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,220
 The only people who drove down Dyer Lane were people who lived on it.

690
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,460
 And that was like three people.

691
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,940
 The road's super big.

692
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,660
 This makes so much sense.

693
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:10,860
 I really wonder how many other haunted locations.

694
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:17,300
 Because see, we're able to see this one because we have haunted house and then nearby, like

695
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,820
 with an eyesight, so you could look out of that second floor and look into this embassy,

696
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,580
 the US Embassy.

697
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,180
 So it's a clear connection there.

698
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:32,660
 I wonder how many of these other spots is where a CIA helicopter will land out in the

699
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:38,620
 middle of nowhere and this road, three-legged lady road, is the best road to get there so

700
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,540
 they don't drive here late at night.

701
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:47,100
 Three-legged lady might jump you and have four legs after she's done.

702
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,580
 Fascinating.

703
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,140
 Fascinating theory, right?

704
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,140
 Conspiracy theory.

705
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:57,100
 Is the CIA using haunted houses as fronts?

706
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,100
 Actually that's a totally different theory.

707
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,580
 What if they're kidnapping people?

708
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,660
 I didn't think about that.

709
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,180
 What if when they are doing that, what do they call it?

710
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,780
 Like extreme rendition?

711
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:10,100
 They kidnap a guy from one country and they fly over to America and they put him in a

712
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,100
 haunted house.

713
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,100
 They put him in a house and everyone in town thinks it's haunted.

714
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,100
 And you just hear a dude screaming super loud.

715
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:21,460
 And you're like, "Oh man, those ghost stories must be true."

716
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,460
 That guy's screaming.

717
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,060
 He's also screaming addresses for some weird reason.

718
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:30,100
 He seems to be giving a lot of information out, a lot of personal information.

719
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,140
 He's giving out names and dates of attacks.

720
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,540
 What's going on in that haunted house?

721
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,700
 What's up with that ghost?

722
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,500
 It's crazy.

723
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,900
 That's a totally different theory.

724
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,100
 What if that's what causes these weird banging noises and these screams?

725
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,740
 Oh my god, that's a totally different theory.

726
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,460
 I don't want to keep using the word fascinating.

727
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,940
 It's almost becoming a cliche on this show.

728
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,620
 And when you do find yourself ghost hunting again, if you've never done it, it's a blast.

729
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:59,820
 I really recommend getting your friends together, doing it safe, being sober, having cell phones

730
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:03,220
 on you and flashlights and knowing where everyone's at.

731
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,780
 You guys will have a ball.

732
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,740
 But you also might run afoul of a CIA operation.

733
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:15,620
 I know when I did real life ghost hunts, I'd always say our main worries are bums and dogs.

734
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,300
 Because you're out in the middle of nowhere.

735
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:23,020
 There may or may not be trespassing on private property.

736
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,020
 Dogs and bums.

737
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,540
 There's not many bums in your own houses.

738
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,980
 But it could be a private property that's an abandoned house and stuff like that.

739
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,980
 Bums and dogs.

740
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:35,900
 And I never ever ever thought that I could be walking around a spooky haunted house and

741
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:42,860
 there's a CIA agent currently torturing a guy the floor above me.

742
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:47,900
 So yeah, I guess there's another reason to be extra cautious when you go ghost hunting.

743
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,260
 Because bums in the Central Intelligence Agency.

744
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:59,540
 It turns out that ghost stories may actually contain more horror than just the paranormal.

745
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:06,660
 You may end up crossing the path of a CIA operative while they're doing their duty.

746
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:14,980
 But also this again may shed a lot of light on who knows how many hauntings.

747
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,300
 Are they real?

748
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:23,300
 Or is it a government cover up?

749
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,980
 Wish I had thought of this myself.

750
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,660
 Honestly I wish I had thought of this conspiracy theory myself.
