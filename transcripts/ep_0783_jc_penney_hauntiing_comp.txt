 put down that bowl of stewed tomatoes because today we're gonna take a look at
 a Chinese artist who did whatever it took to make a point or so I don't even
 know what the point of his thing was but he did something super gross and then
 we travel to the bedroom of a young boy who's trying to catch some peaceful
 sleep instead he finds himself thrust into a world of the afterlife where
 nothing is as it seems today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio I'm your
 host Jason Carpenter or I'm having a great day I hope you guys are having a great day too
 I hope you guys have already eaten because if you are eating while listening
 to this episode Godspeed to you I would not recommend it but one thing that I
 would recommend is coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now they're eating a
 big bowl of stew mmm this is extra chunky it's Nigel King everyone give a round of
 applause to Nigel King he's walking in with stew he made it for all of us but
 he's the only one eating it Nigel you're gonna be our captain our pilot this
 episode if you guys can't support the patreon I totally understand just help
 spread the word about the show really really helps out a lot now Nigel I hope
 you brought some cornbread because I will eat that cornbread's always delicious
 a little bit of butter a little bit of jelly this isn't a cooking podcast this
 is a paranormal podcast that often just becomes grossed gross stories podcast so
 Nigel I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durchable we're
 leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command we are floating all the way out to China so in
 China there is a little restaurant actually sorry about to get a lot of
 trouble actually we could get about to get in a lot of trouble with various
 governments over the world we're actually starting off the story by heading to
 Taiwan
 Durchable kind of turns a little bit right we're headed to Taiwan in Taiwan in
 Chaiye City in Taiwan there's a little restaurant and we walk into the
 restaurant ding ding ding little door little doorbell and we sit down at the
 tables and the cook comes up to us and he goes I know what you guys are here for
 you guys are here for the special you guys look like a bunch of disgusting
 human beings you guys are here for the most special food I have and he goes to
 orders of yin yang fish that was the sound that was the sound of a couple
 people shutting off the podcast because they know exactly where this one's going
 the yin yang fish it's this real delicacy and this is how you perform it so
 now we're back in the kitchen we're watching him cook this and he goes and
 he reaches into a big bucket of water and he pulls out a fish like a carp like a
 big old fish right and it's like breathing if it's not breathing that's
 the thing it's a fish he pulls it out of the water it's trying to breathe but it
 can't it's just breathing in oxygen and so then he goes guys you guys are gonna
 love you guys you guys are sick you guys are sick individuals right you guys
 are gonna love this he then takes the yin yang fish and he starts to scale it
 descale it while it's still alive and we're like looking at each other like
 oh it's kind of messed up like does that hurt he's like oh fish I don't know does
 anything hurt does anything hurt he has no nerve any since he was born without
 the ability to feel pain he starts descaling himself he's like look it I'm
 not feeling anything he's bleeding all over the kitchen we're like oh he
 descales the fish while it's still alive and he's like and then he takes out
 like a filet knife and we're like oh no and he starts to gut the fish while it's
 still alive and we're just looking at his little mouth going ah mama then he
 takes the fish and he holds it up by its head and he dips it into boiling oil
 all the way up to its head and it pulls it out this guy has now been completely
 burned but you can still eat it if you still have an appetite and the yin yang
 fish also known as the dead or alive fish is served to you and it's been
 cooked alive gutted alive descaled alive and while you're eating it its head is
 looking at you and its mouth is moving there's videos of this which I'm
 unfortunate enough that I was reading the article but then I was like well I
 gotta see I gotta see a video of this and sure enough it's exactly how I
 described it so let me describe it to you again in graphic detail I'm gonna
 watch the video and talk along with it so here's the thing so this video came
 out and it went viral and people were really really upset the fact that you
 were eating this fish while it was still alive which I don't know what's more
 horrific being cooked alive or being cooked half alive and then like you're
 sitting there you're like remember that old Tom Petty music video this video
 terrified me as a kid that old Tom Petty video where Alice in Wonderland is
 trying to run away from Tom Petty and then he turns her into a cake and then
 they eat her that I that movie that oh my god that terrified me as a kid but
 anyways and she's looking she's like no no they're eating me no I need my thighs
 what would be worse to be cooked alive or to be cooked just enough that you can
 watch yourself be eaten I guess actually that's not even the one where you're
 watching yourself be eaten is the worst but these people are eating this fish and
 he's like looking at them imagine I don't know why he tried to put you into this
 hellish position but someone takes a spoonful of you and then you see the
 spoonful of you move past your eyes into someone's mouth that's what I'm trying
 to get at that's what this fish is seeing absolutely despicable now the chef
 says listen he's saying this from behind bars they get ready to execute him no
 no he actually had a little bit of blowback from this but apparently they
 still sell it he goes listen you idiots you guys are morons the fish is
 obviously dead the fish died when I removed its guts right it died it
 suffocated from not being able to breathe what you're seeing is simply the
 synapses what you're seeing is the nerve endings you see it's just simulating
 that it's an undying agony it's actually been dead for a while that's his
 defense now again imagine you were corpse I was joking imagine you were a corpse
 and someone is pretending you were alive we did that episode a long time ago I
 don't even remember what it was where people were putting soy sauce in the
 octopus brains and would make the octopus dance around on your plate and I
 thought what if you could put a soy sauce helmet on a captured soldier and
 you'd turn him into a zombie and have him run across the battlefield like what
 a psychological weapon that would be it would be super convainting you have the
 special forces they're bringing along all their gear and then they also have this
 giant industrial sized soy sauce packet they're like trying to tear the tip off
 and just squeeze into some dude's brain but what it work the point is is like
 whether or not the fish is alive the fish the fish it looks like it's an
 agony it's a horrible all around so I read about this yin-yang fish and it's
 just gross and there's a video of people eating it and it's looking at him and
 maybe he's still alive maybe he's not but then that led me to look at more
 disgusting stuff so now we're headed to mainland China so hop back in this
 dead rabbit dirgeable we're going to Beijing to meet a man known as Zhu Yu in
 the 90s he became super popular and you know like there's different types of
 art schools like there's like hi I'm a cubist so like I draw pictures and
 everyone looks like Minecraft or I'm like gothic so it's like I make pillars
 and hide-and-sme-clothes and like gothic art everything super spooky in the
 candles or like you just walk around candles through spooky houses and then
 there's like modern art which is like here's some dust you walk into the
 exhibit they just throw dust in your eyes that'll be $500 please that's art
 you have all these different schools of arts Picasso did something I think he
 was like cube cube I think he was a cubist as well I did take an art history
 class in college technically I took a heart is art history class I never went
 though it's super boring there weren't enough hot girls in the class to keep me
 interested but anyways so all of that has led up to that monologue there's
 different types of art but there is a school of art known as the cadaver school
 and that is where your milieu your genre of art is body part stuff there's
 enough of these people that they have their own school it's not like Hogwarts
 it's not like there's like a physical school you can go to or is there but you
 go to a mortuary and you walk in between the fourth and fifth body and then you
 end up in the cadaver school it's enough artists worldwide that they use that as
 their template they use that as their canvas the blood is my paint in the
 sin you'd flesh is where I put stuff it's not just one sicko there's enough of
 these lunatics out there that they formed their own school and so Zhu Yu in
 China is one of these guys and he had here let's look at some of his art
 because I've learned from doing the show that I love going through performance
 art I would never attend one in real life I think it's super boring but I love
 reading about them because they're super lame so anyways here's this guy he'd
 made a art one of his art pieces was called skin graft where he had skin
 cut from himself and put on a giant flank a giant cut of pork he could chase
 this awesome you're telling me I can go to an art show and watch a man get his
 skin cut off no I don't think so I think he just brought the most interesting
 part is him screaming in agony he's like this is all for the cadaver school as
 he's cutting out this piece of skin no he just shows up with a big piece of
 pork and goes that's my skin on there that's super lame dude then he has this
 thing this is better this is better I might go to this one go to this one just
 to pull pranks he had a thing called pocket theology in 1999 he had got this
 room and he had a long coiling rope pretty much covering every inch of the
 floor so there's just a rope everywhere and then the rope is hanging so it's like
 all this rope on the ground and then the rope is hanging from a severed arm a
 severed human arm is holding onto this rope and the arm is stuck on a meat hook
 that's hanging from the ceiling so it's this decayed rotting arm holding this
 rope and the art exhibit is you have to walk over the rope as the viewer it's
 like in the middle of this museum so basically you're walking you get to
 this room and the only way to continue on to the dinosaur exhibit the only way
 to get to the gift shop you have to walk over this rope now and when I first
 read that I got laughing to the thought of this smelly human arm hanging I
 thought that would be creepy because you're not just walking over any rope
 you're basically walking over an extension of this rotting arm it's an
 interesting trick it was just a rope on the ground some other lesser lame or
 artist out there right would be like oh this is called rope it's called the
 tangled of the masses pay me ten thousand dollars and I'll throw this rope in
 your museum like I don't have a lot of appreciation for modern art and it's so
 funny because I happen to run in circles of people who've loved this type of
 garbage and it's just a miracle of sociology that I can get along a lot of
 my friends would be like oh my god tangled of the masses is coming to
 Portland I can't wait anyways it doesn't involve body parts or
 Optimus Prime I am not there so zoo you also have this this is what he's most
 famous for and if you didn't shut off when I said ying ying fish I'm sure a
 lot of people shut off when I said zoo you this is what he's most famous for in
 the East Link gallery back in 2000 in Shanghai China there's this art
 exposition it's supposed to be all of this like outsider art like really in
 your face art at the East Link gallery in 2000 and zoo you shows up with a set of
 photographs but what the photographs were were disgusting and really I think
 disgusting is probably underselling it zoo you have this exhibit it was called
 eating people and what he did a lot of people have tried disputing this but he
 has never disputed it people have tried changing and saying oh no no he later in
 life he said that it wasn't true I could find no record that he ever denied this
 snopes ran a big article about saying oh no no it's not true it's not true he
 has never denied it and even in the snopes article they were saying well
 well what he did might have been true but we think it was this like people have
 been going out of their way to dispute something that he has never denied doing
 eating people is zoo you it's a series of photographs of him sitting there
 eating a six-month-old human fetus these photos went viral and what it became was
 this thing and you might have seen these photos back in the early 2000s they were
 saying this huge thing like look at what they're eating in China they're eating
 babies here's a photo of just a normal Chinese guy sitting down for a delicious
 breakfast and so people were debunking that and that's where snopes came in and
 they're like normal Chinese people are not eating babies this is a photo that's
 attributed to a performance artist and snopes goes on to say we don't even
 believe he's eating the baby we think they took a duck and put a doll's head on
 it I don't know much about human anatomy but I know it doesn't look a lot like duck
 anatomy anyways he does not deny it he came out and said there's nothing wrong
 with cannibalism and he's he puts it out like this there's another wrong with
 cannibalism as long as it can be done in a way with that does not end in a crime
 being committed so if someone is willingly giving their body in his mind I
 think it's disgusting right I'm not giving him any wiggle room but he's
 saying as long as you can not commit a crime while committing cannibalism is
 there anything wrong with cannibalism he said that he said it's not forbidden by
 any laws or religion which I'm pretty here's the thing I don't know if that's
 true it may is it against a lot of eat people I know they have things like
 abuse of a corpse is a law so you and they could classify cannibalism of that
 if you someone dies of natural means but then you turn them into a marionette
 puppet that's a crime right if you eat them and there there's no survival
 situation that would be a crime as well I don't know honestly if in the Bible
 they talk about cannibalism and it's weird because they were constantly
 starving to death back then I think people were eating each other I do
 remember reading books about ancient warfare ancient Hebrew warfare is real
 Israeli warfare and there would be sieges and people would eat each other
 back then but I don't know if in the Bible it specifically says don't eat
 people what's so bizarre is he views his artwork as a protest he's protesting
 people he's protesting people who don't like cannibalism so he's basically
 protesting everyone here I'll tell you exactly what happened with this dude so
 you exactly what happened to this dude he says he he almost threw up a couple
 times all he's getting ready to eat this baby but he finally was able to eat it
 and he's never denied it nowadays he's like painting pebbles and rocks and he's
 doing like art art he's doing Jason art he's doing art and Jason would consider
 art I think he just wanted some attention I think there is my two scenarios
 here's my three scenarios one he's a groundbreaking artist who would stop at
 nothing no matter what taboos were in front of him could have been doing that
 to he could just have been an attention seeker I think that a lot of
 performance artists are comedians who stand up comedians who have stage fright
 so they just do wacky stuff and they do stuff out of the sight of others and
 take photographs and things like that of it or this was some sicko sex thing as
 well right we can't discount that he's just always wanted to eat somebody when
 he was a young kid he saw that movie alive about the Brazilian soccer players
 crashing into the mountain and he's like that's me I want to do that someday in
 his entire life he was going to enter any job possible that would allow him to eat
 people first off he tried playing soccer that didn't pan out and then he tried
 becoming like an adventurer hoping he'd get stranded with a bunch of people in
 a cave and then maybe eat them but people got a little worried because he never
 brought like survival gear he just brought a fork and knife everywhere and
 then he goes you know what I'll do I'll just be a performance artist then I'll
 eat a baby like okay that last one might be the most convoluted of the three he
 probably sees himself as the taboo breaking artist but I so weird and
 gross right eating the baby eating the baby if it's a little more intense than
 just listening to an M&M song so when you're talking about art and pushing
 buttons that just seems too much I have since we're here no let's go on to the
 next segment let's go ahead hop in that dead rabbit durable let's head to London
 England because I'll cover this guy as well he's another performance artist he
 actually beat out a zoo you by a couple years he'd been doing this stuff before
 his name is Rick Gibson and he back in 1984 made a set of earrings that don't
 tell me I don't know why all this stuff I really don't know why I found all this
 stuff in the same two or three days the Google algorithm must be doing my job
 for me or it just must be possessed by MOLOC Rick Gibson decided to start wearing
 these earrings I don't know if he wore him around town I don't know I might for
 all I know he made him and took a photograph of him and show that the
 museum it was matching earrings and each one was a 10-week-old fetus so it's
 like hey he's dancing he's like hey ladies what's going on they're like oh
 my god it's the most disgusting thing ever so then he's like I shouldn't wear
 these out to pick up women or women who do go home with them that's just wrong
 right they're like oh I really love your earrings in that then he had this weird
 down slide he had this weird down slide he did that that's a big show stuff right
 like how do you where do you go from wearing fetus earrings in 1986 he stood
 in front of government buildings in England holding a rat he had this rat
 and he would hold it up in front of the doors because get it like government
 officials are rats oh that's lame dude I'm not saying I'm not saying go harder into
 the fetus stuff but what a come down he's holding up the rat get it they're
 rats but then he came back he came back swinging hard July 23rd 1988 he's in
 London everyone's like oh great he's doing the rat thing again boring he's like
 oh no I need something super crazy he cannibalism he goes the cannibalism
 route he's eating a canape you know what a canape is I didn't it's a crack it's a
 cheese and cracker right it's that's what we would just call it hey can I have
 some cheese and crackers but I guess I guess if you want to spend $50 on a
 cracker after you've gone seen the tangle of the masses you take a cracker you put
 some cheese on it maybe like a tomato or some basil or something like that he is
 standing in the middle of London and he has one of those and he's like doodododo
 and he puts on top of it this is so gross this to me is grosser than the fetus
 because I can't really comprehend that right like I have seen pictures of fetus
 I've seen the photos of this guy eating the fetus the zoo you guy but it's all
 alien it's an abstract thought to me I've never held a baby I've seen them from
 afar they terrify me what I do know I do know a lot about because I'm constantly
 looking at my throat because I always have sore throats is tonsils so this
 dude has this cracker and on top of it he has human tonsils and he eats it now
 that's hard that's relatable no one likes tonsils right there everywhere
 they're constantly coming out of mouths you can eat that I would have been I
 would have been Bravo Bravo then he had to updo that right you your performance
 artist you're an artist you have to keep doing better and better April 15th a
 year later 1989 this time he shows up and the police are ready for him because
 the fetus earings were gross but it's like 1984 and people are like what
 huh it's just super bizarre and then the rat thing was so lame but now he's just
 ate some human tonsils the previous year it was this huge uproar the police
 are looking for this guy they're looking for him he's like constantly hanging
 outside a dentist office he's like more delicious tonsils this time he shows up
 and he eats so he has two of these to eat he has two of this segment is going
 on way too long but I'm getting way too much enjoyment he has two of these to
 eat so start thinking about body parts that you can eat two of and you can put
 in your pocket we'll say so it's not feet which have really big pockets he
 sits there and he has two of these and he eats the first one and people are just
 sickened they're outraged what it's so gross and the police move in and they
 arrest this guy and during the scuffle he drops the second one and rolling around
 the truth story rolling around in the streets of London falls out of his hand
 a human testicle so it ain't the first one no problem you can always eat at
 least one testicle no one can stop that first swallow but when they saw him go
 oh and then they saw him reach into his pocket to pull out the other milky white
 I imagine they're like giant wall I imagine it's like oh if you took a wall
 nut and dipped it in milk maybe white paint maybe for a little more viscosity
 but they have this we have this walnut size thing and it's rolling around the
 ground and I can just imagine as the cops are cuffing him he's like no lefty
 no he's watching this left testicle kind of roll down the streets getting close
 to the sewer will it fall in no it doesn't actually apparently one of his
 supporters can you believe this guy has fans one of his supporters must have
 scooped up the testicle good old lefty because this dude I don't remember his
 name it's too busy talking about what he's eating Rick Gibson gets taken gets
 arrested gets taken to jail gets released right with not a big deal the judge goes
 there's really not a crime against eating human testicles we're assuming
 it's from a willing donor and then a year later he shows up that exact same
 spot he has that other testicle all he eats that one as well what's worse
 what's really worth eating a human testicle or eating a testicle that's
 been sitting out for a year right that's discovered makes it even worse I
 don't think he was just sitting in his cupboard next to his top rom and it's
 like slowly getting moldy and it's like getting harder and harder he's like oh
 now really is like a walnut yes he's a nutcracker to get to the juicy goodness I
 don't know I don't I'm so he put it in the fridge then you got to worry like
 did he get freezer burn did it ruin the flavor did he really get the full
 flavor of the testicle a year later Nigel let's go ahead and toss you the
 keys to the carbonicopter we are leaving behind all of this madness in London we
 are headed all the way out to a tiny little house in the middle of the
 suburbs to the story online very very interesting story with really bizarre
 implications let's kind of dig into this real quick here there's this young boy
 young 12 year old boy let's call him Robbie Robbie has a best friend named
 Devin who's about to turn 10 years old but shortly before Devin's 10th birthday
 he's killed in a car accident little Devin little nine-year-old Devin is
 walking down the street there's a driver has a seizure she loses control of the
 car it jumps the curb and runs him over now Robbie didn't know that this had
 happened the day that it all took place he wasn't there and his parents didn't
 know how to tell him like this is the first real loss as a child is losing
 one of your friends like that they didn't know what to do so they actually
 asked his aunt hey would you mind taking Robbie for a couple days we need to get
 some stuff settled here yeah yeah sure of course and that day when he gets home
 from school he actually packs up and goes to stay at his aunt's house for a
 couple days he has no idea what's happened to Devin and that night that
 very first night after Devin had passed away Robbie has a dream he dreams he's
 in a department store like a JC Penney's so you got the linoleum floors that give
 you a guided pathway through the store and then the carpeted areas where all of
 the fixtures are at you have racks and racks of clothes the perfume counter
 those pillars that kind of dot the landscape and then you have the clothes
 on the circular racks you'd always see a sea of those as well you would just sit
 there and you kind of flip through the clothes like you're looking through a
 magazine page by page and they'd be on these circular racks and these racks if
 you've ever been in a malls which I kind of have to say because not everyone
 gets the opportunity to go in a malls or department stores anymore that they
 exist less and less but there was all I mean shopping is super boring rather go
 see performance art and go shopping but I was always dragged going shopping with
 my mom standing there and those circular racks were always creepy to me
 because they were child height and you never saw was on the other side of them
 now it was kind of that mixed bag like sometimes we like to hide in them it was
 funny for us to go in there as children and be like who wonder where I'm at play
 hide-and-seek and in a crowded department store we did that back in the day but
 it's also creepy because they're the perfect size for a kid to get lost in
 their perfect size for a kid to get pulled into who knows what's in there
 so there's this weird fascination I think that you have with those circular
 racks in this dream Robbie is seeing these circular racks and out of one of
 the racks Devin pops out sticks a little head out of the rack of clothes
 Robbie goes hey Devin what's going on hey how's it going and Devin snuck back
 into the rack what Robbie's looking here and he's looking in this department
 store and people are just kind of shuffling around shopping and he sees
 Devin poke his head out of another rack of clothes just kind of looking at Robbie
 Devin what's going on hey man how's it going we play hide-and-go-seek who's it
 I'm assuming I am since you're the one he ducked back into the rack of clothes and
 so Robbie begins to walk through the department store and every time he gets
 to a circular rack he sees Devin's head pop out of it but as he gets closer
 Devin disappears back into the circular rack and appears at a farther off one so
 no matter how far Robbie's moving through the store he's always not able to
 catch up to Devin and this happens Devin keeps getting farther and farther away
 in these racks of clothes he's popping out farther and farther away and then for
 the first time in this dream Devin speaks he says I have to go
 Robbie wakes up later later that week Robbie is told that Devin had passed
 away Devin was killed in that accident and so that dream kind of sat on Robbie
 was obviously a difficult dream and when he found out that that was the night
 that Devin had died made it even more impactful six months after this whole
 thing he's visiting Devin's house for the first time since the accident he went
 there and he's talking to the stepmom and he's talking to Devin siblings and
 they're just kind of reminiscing and when I'll detail this whole thing that
 Robbie was saying was so weird was that the stepmom Devin stepmom showed him a
 little container full of teeth and she said I got these from the accident scene
 when Devin got hit by the car and knocked out some of his teeth I saved
 him she's holding out this little container for Robbie to see so just an
 odd a detail to it a grief you know the grieving process so Robbie was really
 creeped out by that but he was even more creeped out by the fact that he's
 talking to the stepmom and the stepmom goes you want you want to know the
 weirdest thing about all of this I'm you know other than the teeth I'm collecting
 I had a dream about Devin after he died I had a dream I was in this big
 department store you know normal typical department store the clothing on those
 circular racks and I'm standing in this department store and Devin popped out of
 one of the racks and no matter how close I got to him he was always just out of
 reach
 it's an interesting creepy story it makes you wonder about what the natures of
 dreams are are they a way for spirits to communicate with us what's really going
 on the fact that he didn't know that that's pretty standard in ghost lore and
 dream lore people having no news of an event that has happened and then in
 their dream being alerted to someone who had died earlier that day a long time
 listener of the show Beatrice sent me in a story that's very similar to this about
 her grandmother who passed away came to her in a dream and she wasn't aware that
 the grandmother had died in the sleep so and it's very standard for good thanks
 for sharing the story Beatrice as well it's very standard for ghost lore stuff
 so a standard interesting ghost story it correlates with the lore the things that
 we know about ghosts what when I was reading this story though what I was
 thinking was like we all got the imagery right when I described it you could
 almost you can imagine the lighting the right lighting for this JC pennies you
 can imagine exactly how it's laid out here's my question I've been thinking
 about this a lot kid poking his head out from the turnstile of the clothing the
 rolling racks that's creepy right no one liked being around those things because
 they were creepy you would always think someone would get out and get you I told
 the story about Beatrice's grandmother who came back to say it's okay honey I
 love you after the grandmother had passed away and Beatrice didn't know
 about that I left out the part where Beatrice's grandma is floating is like
 floating down the hallway here's my question do ghosts know they're being
 creepy do ghosts understand because he used to be alive they should be fully
 aware that floating floating down the hallway doing inhuman things is going
 to scare us appearing to us late at night popping out of the turnstiles of
 clothing just until your friend gets a little bit closer and then you disappear
 and then do it out another one not only is that terrifying you're kind of a
 jerk do ghosts understand they're being creepy now sure we could say the
 malevolent ghosts the demons things like that that's their goal what about the
 time so little little little Robbie I think his name was recording this way
 recording this hours later the original ending went on for a long time and it
 wasn't that good this is my second take what do we call I think it was Robbie or
 is that that's the kid from the first story from Mexico he's like hey for
 yesterday's episode is the factory still haunted anyways the point is is that
 imagine imagine you were the narrator of that story and how distraught you you
 don't even know your friends dead yet and how to start you would feel you know
 something's off and you're trying to just say hi you're being led in your dream
 and he gets disappearing why would Devon's ghost choose to do that twice he
 did it to his stepmom too he's like that was so funny what I did that other kid I
 totally forgot his name that lame oh he's still alive I don't even remember who
 he is I had so much fun doing that I'm gonna do it to my stepmom and give me my
 teeth back you weirdo that's so weird that's like it's just a sad detail about
 collecting the teeth having the teeth but anyways I mean that that's how real
 people in real life are creepy but let's talk about how people in the world of
 the dead could be creepy and I don't know if I've given them credit yet this all
 came from an online post written by couple technical 16 795 so couple
 technical if I haven't given you a shot out yet I apologize but yeah just to
 wrap it up like when I'm reading the storm thing and does Devon know how
 creepy this is do ghosts choose to do creepy things or do ghosts live in a
 since they're in the afterlife and they live in this different dimension is it
 so irrational like they think they're things when he's doing is totally normal
 he's in a brand new reality thinking about like floating a couple inches off
 the floor of the hallway at night coming through the doors being like I love
 you I'm just gonna tear anyone I mean it was a beautiful story of a grandmother's
 love piercing the veil but would you choose to do that if one if you passed
 away and you had to greet one of your loved ones we're like what's the heaviest
 chains I can borrow what's the spookiest time I can't appear no you would show
 what like I would show up right and I'd show up how everyone always remembered
 me unwashed jeans and a t-shirt and I would walk and I would sit there they'd
 be like do it'd be like in the middle of lunch or something like that they're
 trying to work they're on their commute to work and I'm like hey guys what's up
 sit in the fast food seat ah I would show up and I'd be like hey remember me it
 was of course you remember me I'm totally awesome and they're like they're
 holding their noses they're like uh you just don't wash your jeans in the
 afterlife either I was like listen hey man I really loved you and I wish I
 could have told you one last time how cool you were but I died horrible
 harpoon accident so here I am I just have this giant harpoon sticking through my
 heart I'm dripping ectoplasm all over your staking eggs here I am I just
 came to give you hug and I chased you around the house trying to take you
 with me that's probably what I would do that's probably what I would do if I was
 a ghost I guess that answers the questions ghosts know they're doing
 creepy things and it's hilarious
