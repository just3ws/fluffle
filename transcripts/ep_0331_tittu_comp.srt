1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 A vigilante who loves electrocuting people so much, the media dubbed him "The Proud Father"

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 like a cattle prod.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And then we take a trip to Finland.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Back in the 1700s, an old man was visited by a bird three times.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 And that was just the beginning of a UFO adventure today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Let's go ahead and get started with the episode here.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I want to talk about vigilantes.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Now originally we had a vigilante week planned.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 And then I was like, "Nah, I couldn't really find five good ones. I found four good ones."

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 One of them was those dudes who were cutting the butt holes out of MS-13.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I did that episode a while back.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 And then you're like, "You know you just can't move on from that. I didn't hear that episode."

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Yeah, well listen to that episode. Cutting out butt holes.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 This was another part of vigilante week.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Now we're going to Brooklyn.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 So hold on to your butt holes, boys.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 We hop in the car, we're in the copter.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 We start flying around. We're going to Brooklyn.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 So we land in Brooklyn and there's this Brooklyn rabbi just kind of standing there.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Standing on the street corner and we're like, "Hey, you must be Mendel Epstein."

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 He's like, "How did you know?"

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 And we're like, "Well, because you're holding a cattle prod."

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 And he's like, "Oh, yeah, sorry. Hides behind his back."

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 So this was the story with Mendel Epstein. This is his story.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 In the Orthodox Jewish community, if a woman wants a divorce, she needs to get a git.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And I'm probably pronouncing that wrong, but anyways, probably pronouncing rabbi wrong, to be honest.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 You have to get a git.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 So a git is a like religious document saying that your husband doesn't want to be with you.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Now, the husband can easily say, "No, I don't want a divorce. You're not getting the git."

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And basically it becomes a "Who's on first?" type of situation, but I want the git.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 You don't get the git.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Laugh track.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Actually, it's a really tragic thing.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 The woman's trying to leave her husband.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Now, basically the thing is working out, guys.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 But if he's being abusive or he's having some sort of drug-alcohol problem, he's not healthy for you or the family,

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 the wife can ask for extra-judicial, extra-strong measures to get the git.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 And then they have to go to a day in that's a rabbinical judge.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And the rabbinical judge can say, "We're gonna shun him."

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Like, as a community, we're gonna shun him until you get the git.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 And so that's one way, they're not gonna force him to do it.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 There's little asterisks there, but basically they can make it like,

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 if he goes to do business, they won't do business with him, that type of thing.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 They shun him until finally he's like, "Okay, okay, I'll give my wife a divorce."

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 If that doesn't work, and the most extreme measures, they can beat him up.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And say, "Divorce your wife, divorce your wife."

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 And they're like punching him in the stomach.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 He's like tied up with his hands above his head like in an action movie,

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 and they're like punching him in the stomach until he signs the divorce paper.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 So there's this dude named Mendel Epstein, and he goes, "Yeah, that's way too much leg work."

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 That is not, that's totally not cool.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Like, we need, I'm an advocate for women.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 I'm going to go just to the instep.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 So, and this is kind of an interesting story, because there's two different ways to look at it.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 One, there's the way that I initially read it, and then there's the way that the story ends.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 So, you have this guy who's like sitting in his synagogue, and these crying widows are coming,

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 not widows, what do you need in the force of your widow?

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 These crying women come up to him, and they're like, "My husband's abusing me,

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 and he won't give me the git."

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 And Mendel Epstein's stroking his beard, and he's like, "I can take care of this for you."

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 "I have a posse, I'm going to call up my boys.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 We're going to take this dude out to the middle of nowhere, and take him to Jersey."

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 "We're going to punch him in the stomach a lot."

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And then, we're actually going to like, electrocute him with a cattle prod.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 It's not just a little bit of roughing him up.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 They would take these guys across state lines, and just, they'd torture him for hours,

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 and they would electrocute him with cattle prods on the genitals,

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 which to me, at that point, I'm already getting 50,000 volts going through my skin.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And then he used it on my elbow, and everyone's like, "That's lame."

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 It's still a cattle prod.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 It's still made to move a beast that's a half ton.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Genitals versus my nose. It doesn't matter.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 But anyways, and then miraculously, these women would get a git.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 They could get a divorce.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 For 30 years, he was doing this.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Men in the Jewish community were obviously going to the police and saying,

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 "Hey man, we're getting dragged to us. I woke up in New Jersey.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 My genitals were burned. These dudes beat me up."

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And the police would go, "Well, do you know who did it?"

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 And he's like, "Well, no, they were wearing masks, but I have a pretty good idea.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 I think it was Mendel Epstein and his crew."

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 They have matching leather jackets that say "Prodfather" on them.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Because that ended up being the nickname the media dubbed him

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 when he does get arrested. That's spoiler alert.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 But they called him the "Prodfather" because he ran this gang that electrocuted people with cattle prods.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 He's like, "Lookit, they're wearing these jackets right now.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 They're doing a do-wop group on the corner."

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And the cops are like, "Eh."

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 The cops pretty much ignored all of these complaints.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 And at one point, people were really trying to get law enforcement to investigate this.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And they would either not look into it or the charges would get dropped before trial.

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Men started staging like there was a male rights group outside of Mendel Epstein's home, like protesting.

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 They're like, "What do we want? No more genital shocks. When do we want them? Never to have happened in the first place!"

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 They're all like limping. And nobody can touch Mendel Epstein.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 But what, which is weird. And you're thinking, "Maybe Jason, Jewish conspiracy.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Why would these Jews are being protected by the government?"

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 But the victims are Jews too. So that doesn't wash.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 I think really, I think it comes down to that thing where you have the secular community of New York being like,

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 "We don't want to get involved in whatever religious nonsense this group is doing."

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Like, "We don't know if this is normal. We don't know."

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 And we see that happen a lot. A lot of times, secular governments, when you have these weird offshoots,

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 they'll be like, "We're not going to look into unless it gets really bad."

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 A lot of times, because of the freedom of religion in America,

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 they're a little reluctant sometimes to look into stuff.

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 But anyways, for whatever reason, the FBI eventually goes,

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 "We need to look into this, dude, because we're getting multiple reports of kidnapping and torture."

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Why isn't anyone doing anything about this?

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 They end up scooping up two members of this conspiracy, because it wasn't just him.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 It was like 10 guys. And he's in his 60s at this point.

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 This is in 2013. He'd been doing this for 30 years.

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 They scoop up two people. They turn them against them. They do a scam.

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 They have someone come in and they're like, "Oh, my husband won't give me a get."

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 And Mendel Epstein's like, "I'll take care of it for you."

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 "Let me go grab my cattle prod."

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Now, at this point, he wasn't doing them himself.

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 He's like, "I'm going to go see a movie and then you go do something else."

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 "Your husband's going to get tortured out here."

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 And everyone got scooped up. Everyone got arrested.

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Relatively light sentences. It was like, I think, the most anyone got was 8 years.

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 A lot of them got 4 years.

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 But I remember reading the story and I go, "Vigilanteism."

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Like, fighting against corruption.

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And in that case would be if a drunken, abusive husband is like beating his wife

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 and she's like, "All I want to do is divorce."

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 And he's like, "Never!"

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Beating her up.

131
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And then someone like kind of steps into the room and he's like, hands off of her

132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 and then like, electrocutes him in the genitals?

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 That's a vigilante. That's something Daredevil would do.

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Or Spider-Man. Spider-Man might not electrocute him in the genitals.

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 But vigilanteism is standing up for the weak against the strong.

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Whatever case that could be.

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Like, there's an abusive government and you know, you're running and you're punching up a bunch of cops.

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 You're like, "Ceatin' him in the dick."

139
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Or it could be something as simple as someone's getting the tar kicked out of him next to your house

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 and you walk outside and you're like, "Stop, people doer!"

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 I don't recommend doing either of those, by the way, because they'll probably end poorly.

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 But again, this guy, I was reading this and I was like, "He is a vigilante.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 This guy will be part of Vigilante Week."

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 But I didn't end up doing Vigilante Week.

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 I set it aside and then I go, "Oh, I want to cover this story again."

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 I always thought it was interesting.

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Basically, a rebel rabbi fighting for the good of women who were in bad situations.

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Turns out, when I re-read this story, I missed the key detail.

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 He charged them insane amounts of money to do this.

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 So first off, you had to pay $10,000 just for him to go to a rabbinical court to go to the day in and be like, "I need to do this get thing."

151
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 So he had to basically pay off another rabbi to allow him to take this extra measure.

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 And then it was an additional $60,000 for the operation.

153
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 He's like, "You got to pay my boys. My boys don't do this for free. What? You think justice is free?"

154
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 She'd be like, "Yeah, kind of. No, it's not. You got to pay me.

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 I mean, you got to pay someone $10,000 to take care of this.

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 So you give me $10,000, I'll go to this judge."

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 And then it's additional $60,000 to have your husband driven across state lines and beat up.

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Now, they did this 30 times.

159
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 So 70 times 30 is...

160
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 What? So that basically would be $210,000 over the course.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 No, it'd have to be more than that, right?

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 I've got to get my calculator.

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 You're so mad right now. You're like, "Jason, do you really need a calculator for 70,000 times 30?"

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 I do.

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Because I think it's $2,100,000, but that seems too low.

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 It might be $2.1 million, honestly.

167
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 I got the 21 right, so you can't get too mad at me.

168
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Let's see here.

169
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 70,000 times...

170
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Compelling podcasting, I know. 30 years.

171
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 And it was about once per year. It was about one victim per year.

172
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Yeah, $2.1 million.

173
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 So, I mean, that's not a bad haul.

174
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 I guess that's not a lot of money over the course of 30 years, though.

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 But, yeah, so anyways, not really a vigilante if you charge people $70,000 per head.

176
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 I'd love to see Batman be watching over the city, and there's someone getting their purse snatched.

177
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 He jumps down and beats some guy up, and then he turns to the lady, and he goes,

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 "I'll take half a wudip whenever it's in your purse."

179
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 She's like, "Ah, he has his utility belt as full of breath mints, tampons, and like $5.00 and changed,

180
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 that he's gotten throughout his night of crime fighting."

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Not a vigilante if you charge money for it.

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 I can understand if you, like, raise funds, or you steal money from the people you're attacking.

183
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 But other than that, come on.

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 So, not a vigilante. Just a guy who really liked electrocuting people in the genitals, i.e. Jigsaw.

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story here.

186
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Our next story is a request from Finland.

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 We have a lot of Finland listeners.

188
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 They really came out of the woodwork when I made all those Finland jokes a while back.

189
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 This is Baba. Wait, is it? It's Baba Baba is this person. I left out a Baba.

190
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Baba Baba. Baba Baba sent me an email after our Finland story.

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 It's a tale known as Tituvari.

192
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 So come here. Sit. Now, all of a sudden, you're-- I'm an old Finnish man sitting in a, like, log cabin.

193
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 I don't know where they build stuff out of there. Gingerbread.

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 We're in a gingerbread house built in Finland, right? So I'm like an old papa.

195
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 And I have an old pipe full of nude tobacco, because otherwise that would be disgusting.

196
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 And you guys are all children now. I'm like, come here. Get off my lap.

197
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 So now, that's gross. You got cooties. You all got cooties.

198
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Just sit in a circle around me. I will tell you the story of Tituvara.

199
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Tituvari, I meant, as I re-looked at my notes.

200
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Puffing on my pipe.

201
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 So thank you, Baba Baba, for the adventure we're about to tell.

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 The year is 1701. And we're in Sahalati, Finland.

203
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 And I point out the window, and that's exactly where we're at. We're at Sahalati, Finland.

204
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And I'm like, why are we sitting down? Let's go on an adventure.

205
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 So we all stand up. You guys are like, "Yay, yay, yay, Jason, yay, yay."

206
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And I'm like, should we get out together?

207
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Trying to kick you off my legs. We open the door, and we walk outside.

208
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And it's beautiful. It's Finland. It's all green and lush.

209
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 I assume. Could be disgusting garbage heap over there. I don't know.

210
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Anyways, we're walking across this town, this little town of Sahalati.

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 And we see Tituvari. We're just going to call him Titu for now.

212
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Titu is actually his name. I think "Vari" means grandpa.

213
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 But anyways, everyone in town loved this dude.

214
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Like, nobody hated him, which is kind of what I meant.

215
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 When I said everyone loved him, he was a good guy.

216
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 He was not a guy who would have his butthole taken out.

217
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Anyways, he's walking. No, no, he's done walking. He's in his house.

218
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And one day a bird...

219
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 [imitates bird cawing]

220
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 lands on his roof. And he looks out his window and he goes,

221
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 "Oh, there's a bird on my roof."

222
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 And then, [imitates bird cawing]

223
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 It was not a boomerang. That's the bird flying away.

224
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 And he's like, "Ah, it was an interesting day.

225
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 I can't wait to tell everyone in town about the bird that landed on my roof."

226
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 It's a very, very slow town. Provincial life.

227
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 This town makes the town and beauty and the beast look like Las Vegas.

228
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 It's that slow. It's that provincial.

229
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Oh, news in town. Do you hear a bird landed on Titu's roof?

230
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 I know, dude. I wish it was there to see that.

231
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Next day, Titu is hanging out in his house,

232
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 drinking some tea or whatever they drink over there, gingerbread, coffee.

233
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 And... [imitates bird cawing]

234
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Bird lands on his roof. And he's like, "Can it be? Can it have happened twice in two days?"

235
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 And then [imitates bird cawing]

236
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Bird flies off. And at this point, Titu is like,

237
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 "Hmm, it's a little too much excitement in this town."

238
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Okay, he's drinking some more gingerbread coffee.

239
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 The next day in town, Titu's hanging out in his house.

240
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 And he hears, "Cock, cock, cock!"

241
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 He kind of looks at his window and he sees the bird approach.

242
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Wait, no, that's it going the opposite direction. It lands.

243
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 And then [imitates bird cawing]

244
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Flies away.

245
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 And at that point, Titu turns to his wife, okay?

246
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 This story is so weird and it's weird.

247
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 I almost feel like it's true. And I'll get into that in a second.

248
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 But anyways, Titu turns to his wife.

249
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 He turns and he says to his wife,

250
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 "I got order to go to the woods, and I have to obey that order."

251
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Apparently, he's also a Barack Obama's ancestor.

252
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 But he's not. He's not Barack Obama's ancestor.

253
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 He does, though, tell his wife that he does have to go to the woods.

254
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 The bird landing on his roof three times means it's time for him to go to the woods.

255
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 So he gets up, and the wife's like, "Now?"

256
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And he's like, "Yeah, I gotta take care of this now.

257
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 The bird is telling me to go to the woods."

258
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 So then he just walks off into the middle of the woods.

259
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Later that day, everyone in town is just kind of going about their business.

260
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 They're like, "Dude, did you hear Titu went into the woods?"

261
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Like, "I know that bird landed three times. I wonder what it could mean."

262
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 And worth staying around, we're going, "Nothing! It means nothing!"

263
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Birds land on roofs all the time.

264
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 I don't say that out loud, because there's a real kind of "children of the corn" vibe in this town.

265
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 We're afraid we're going to get murdered if we speak out.

266
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And then...

267
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 We look up, and there's a massive UFO flying over town.

268
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 It appears out of nowhere.

269
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 It's not like a gradual shadow slowly grows, like an anvil falling on Wiley Coyote.

270
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 It's just...

271
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 When everyone looks up, there's this massive saucer-shaped UFO.

272
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 And it starts flying over town...

273
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Over to the forest.

274
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 And then it disappears.

275
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Now, there's no confirmation to, as it does it, vanish from sight.

276
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Does it fly up at a fast speed? Does it disappear into the tree line?

277
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Does it simply disappear out of view?

278
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 The story goes, it just disappears.

279
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Everyone runs and hides.

280
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Nowadays, everyone's like, "Oh, the UFO, where's my cell phone? I'm going to take video tape, but these aliens are jumping out with laser beams."

281
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 "Oh, I can't wait to put this World Star World Star."

282
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Back then, the giant UFO appeared over your city.

283
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 You ran for cover, because you don't know what's going to happen.

284
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Plus, World Star is not around yet, so why take footage? You don't even have a phone.

285
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 You don't even know what phone is, or a camera.

286
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Anyways, spaceship flies overhead. Everyone ran into their houses.

287
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Now, I would do that probably too. I always think about that.

288
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 If I was walking to work, or walking around, and I saw like UFO dropships, like, "Where would I go to hide?"

289
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 It's funny, Mike. I used to think what I would do during a zombie apocalypse, but that's kind of passe, I kind of know everything I would do.

290
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 So now, like, I saw dropships coming and aliens jumping out with laser rifles.

291
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 "Where would I go? Where would I hide?" I kind of play that out in my head.

292
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 I want to do what these guys did.

293
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 They run and hide. They stay in their houses for three days.

294
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Nobody leaves their houses. They're so terrified. They see this UFO over their town.

295
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Nobody leaves their houses for three days.

296
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 The story says that the cows were actually crying.

297
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 [crying]

298
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 No, that's not a-- that's not a promissor.

299
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 This is an all of a sudden, that movie, "Baby, the Lost Dinosaur," from that came out in--

300
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 that stupid movie that came out in the 80s that tried tricking all the kids into thinking it was about dinosaurs.

301
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 You remember that movie? It was called, like, "Baby."

302
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 There's about a little brontosaurus in Africa, and you're like, "Oh, dope. It's going to be about dinosaurs."

303
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 And the cover was a picture of a dinosaur. Okay, to be fair, it is about dinosaurs.

304
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 It's about-- it is about as much about dinosaurs as E.T. is about aliens.

305
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 It's just a cute little puppet dinosaur walking around, and people pet in it, and then some hunter trying to kill it,

306
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 and they make the dinosaur go away at the end.

307
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 It's E.T. with a baby dinosaur, and it sucked.

308
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 So I was so mad, and so many people rented that movie.

309
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 No, I don't care how well it did financially. I don't care about that.

310
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 I remember going over to people's houses, and they'd be like, "Oh, we rented a movie,"

311
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 because it was a big thing to rent a movie back then. It was like five bucks,

312
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 and five bucks was basically like ten bucks when I was a kid.

313
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 You'd be like, "Oh, we rented a movie," and I'd be like, "What? Did you rent-- did you rent Tron?

314
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Did you rent G.I. Joe the movie? No, we rented Babe--"

315
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 [laughs]

316
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 "I'm gonna murder you in your sleep. This sleepover is not gonna last long."

317
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Well, it will for me. I'll sleep like a baby.

318
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Pun intended. So let's-- what was I talking about?

319
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Oh, yeah, the cows.

320
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 [makes noise]

321
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Now, it's funny because when Baba Baba sent me the story, he said that the cows were full--

322
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 like, so hungry. They were like so hungry they hadn't eaten anything in three days.

323
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 They were moan, which is probably the case.

324
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 When I went to go look more into the story, I found a couple of Finnish websites that talked about it,

325
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 and they used the term, "Their udders were full."

326
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 So I think-- I don't know if it's-- I don't know which one's true. It could be both.

327
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 One of them was there like, "Oh, I'm so hungry. I'm just gonna start screaming 'til someone feeds me stuff."

328
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 The other one is that no one was there to milk 'em,

329
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 and so they basically had the equivalent of like just so much milk in their boobies that it hurt.

330
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Which, what I don't understand is then how do cows do it when they don't have little cow babies to drink the milk,

331
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 or do they always have cow babies to drink the milk?

332
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Like, do we make cows constantly have milk in them? Like, by pulling on their nipples? Does that make milk in them?

333
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 I don't know. I don't know anything about, well, really anything that doesn't involve the aliens,

334
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 but like, I don't know how that works. I'm sure that-- I don't think cows constantly have to have milk in them.

335
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Like, do we probably massage the udder or something like that? Or they have baby cow-- I don't know. I don't know anything about it.

336
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Like, I know that if a woman has a baby, she has milk in her boobs,

337
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 but if the baby isn't there, if the baby's like on a road trip or something like that, she can pump the milk.

338
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 But if the baby's nine, she doesn't have milk in her boobs anymore.

339
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 So, does this cow-- do cows constantly have babies so they constantly have milk?

340
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Or is there something else you can do to make them have milk?

341
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Really, the question I'm asking is, can you take a human and constantly massage their boobs and milk shoot out all the time?

342
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 'Cause I've heard that sometimes dudes can have milk come out 'cause the milk ducks are there,

343
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 but I'm gonna think that that's just super disgusting and don't wanna know if I have milk in my body.

344
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 I already have so many other fluids in my body, I don't know what to do with.

345
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 I don't wanna know there's an additional one, that there's cantaloupe-tasting fluid in my body.

346
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Anyways, the cows were crying. That was the point.

347
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 We got two segues out of that one cow crying story. I'm kind of impressed by myself.

348
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 They wouldn't even look out their windows. These people were so scared, they didn't wanna know why the cows were crying.

349
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Giant udder tracks in the dirt, they're just dragging around these giant milk-filled udders.

350
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 [crying]

351
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 But after three days, people kinda, you know, man up and they're like, "Yeah, let's go outside."

352
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 So they go outside and everything's fine. They start milking the cows, they start feeding them at the same time.

353
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 No UFO, everything's normal. But then somebody notices, "Oh dude, you know how we all went hiding in our houses and stuff like that?"

354
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Nobody's seen T2 since. Nobody's seen T2.

355
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Is he in your house now? Is he in your house now? Is he in your house now?

356
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Eventually T2's son says, "I'm gonna go out looking for my dad. Gotta find him."

357
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 See if he's been crying in the forest for three days. [crying]

358
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Big udders, big man udders, hanging low.

359
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Anyways, the son goes out, he goes in the forest looking for him.

360
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 And as T2's son is chilling, well, he's not chilling, he's actually looking for his father.

361
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 He's mourning his loss, hoping he can find this guy.

362
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 He turns a corner, 'cause apparently those exist in nature. He turns and there's a bear.

363
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 [growling]

364
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 That bear walking towards him, giant bear.

365
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 [growling]

366
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Don't fear me. It's useless to search for your father, the bear says.

367
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 This giant bear begins to talk to T2.

368
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 You also saw the ship of the sky, which was shining like a rainbow.

369
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 It took your father up to the heights, to another, better world.

370
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 When the lives erase much higher than your old people, your father feels good in there and doesn't miss home.

371
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 [growling]

372
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Bear wanders back off into the forest.

373
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 So T2's son, after shock, after shock wears off of a bear talking to him and losing his father, goes back into town.

374
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 And he says, "I talked to a bear." And everyone's like, "What?"

375
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 He goes, "That's not even the weird part. I talked to a bear."

376
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 And he said that giant spaceship, the ship of the sky, is what he called it.

377
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Not a spaceship. We don't know what space is yet.

378
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 The giant ship showed up. My dad got on that and he's hanging out with another group of people, a better class of people or something.

379
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 And everyone's like, "Americans?" And he's like, "Probably."

380
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 But I'm assuming that he left his planet.

381
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 And everyone's like, "Oh, that's kind of sad." So they stopped looking for him.

382
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 And so for quite a while, this obviously was the talk of the town.

383
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 A man saw an omen, walked into a field or a forest.

384
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Actually, what happened, Jason? Pay attention to the story you're telling.

385
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 UFO shows up. Guy disappears. Talking Bear shows up. Says, "Don't worry, he's somewhere else."

386
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Now, obviously, that's going to be the talk of the town for a while.

387
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 A new priest arrives in town and he starts hearing the story about talking bears and space stuff.

388
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And he's like, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That stuff is not true."

389
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 We're not even going to talk about that. This is the quote.

390
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 "This story is sinful witchcraft and it represents the twisted mind of drunken mad people.

391
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 It has to be forgotten."

392
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 And it was kind of started being purged out of the town's memory, but obviously, if we're talking about it now, it's still around.

393
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 That's the story of Titu Vari. So let's take a look at the story here real quick.

394
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 So, one, the story seems to have actually be a real story in the sense that it hasn't been made up in the past 20 years.

395
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 It's not an internet meme. It does seem to be a very, very old story.

396
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Two, when we're thinking about it being true, obviously, talking bears and UFOs, you think,

397
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 "Well, you know, that's probably a fictional story. It's probably a fairy tale."

398
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 What I think that's interesting about it is that it doesn't--and this could be a cultural thing--

399
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 but it doesn't--if it's a fairy tale or a fable, there's no--what's the moral? Don't hire a new priest?

400
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Don't go out into the woods if three birds show up? Like, what's--there doesn't seem to be any through line as far as a moral or a fable goes.

401
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 No one gets their comeuppance. No one finds out a new revelation.

402
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 The only thing that really happens is you have a series of events and then someone else shows up and says,

403
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 "I don't want you guys talking about it anymore. It's sinful. It's witchcraft."

404
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 The story takes place in 1701, so remember, at that point, humanity is quite advanced.

405
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Yes, people were still believing in witchcraft and superstitions, but people still believe in that stuff now.

406
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 By 1701, we were technically--let me rephrase that. In 1701, we were about as mentally advanced as we are today.

407
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 When you go farther and farther back, when we're looking at like 400 AD or 600 BC and stuff like that,

408
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 people still were on this totally different wavelength because it was all about fighting for survival every single day.

409
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 These guys are living in a gingerbread town. Society has coalesced. We're only 75 years away from the American Revolution

410
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 and all the stuff that's going on in Europe that I don't know about.

411
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 So we were--now, the big difference between 1701 and 2019 really is technology.

412
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 I would argue that society and culture and everything is fairly the same on a scale, on that short term of a scale.

413
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 The only thing difference is the level of technology we have.

414
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 So it's not like these guys were out cutting toads open and reading the fortunes.

415
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 And if they were, we'd do that today anyways. These guys were fairly rational people.

416
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 I think that--it's funny because when I read this story, it seems very real to me.

417
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 I mean, yeah, you're just--you're like, "There's a talking bear in it!" And I get that.

418
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 But there's just some--because everyone reacts the way people would react, other than the bird landing on the house.

419
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Everyone--I just--I don't--maybe I can't even put it in words.

420
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 The story sounds just as likely to me as happening as the story yesterday about the guy eating space pancakes.

421
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 I think they're both fairly rational stories. And again, yes, one does involve a talking bear,

422
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 but it just seems real to me.

423
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Now, is the story real? This is interesting. I was looking into this.

424
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Baba--BabaBaba basically sent me the version of the story that I just read to you.

425
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 I went and found versions online that matched it up pretty closely, and then I had to look a little bit deeper into the myth.

426
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 If this story--the question is this, Tituvari apparently did really exist, and he did go missing.

427
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Those two things are actually true. The question is, did any of the events happen that are about this?

428
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 What's interesting, looking into the story, is that at the time they were basically doing this big, like, military push in the area.

429
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 A bunch of wars being fought, it was Europe. They were always shooting each other, bashing each other's brains in over something.

430
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 And there was some sort of clause that landowners couldn't be taken out to war.

431
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 So, the theory is that Tituvari, who did own all this land, disappeared, left on purpose, and left the land to his son,

432
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 so his son wouldn't be conscripted to join the military.

433
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 So, the event that we know those events happened. Tituvari actually existed.

434
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 He did go missing, and his son ended up inheriting his land.

435
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 The question is, did it involve a UFO and a talking bear, or was it simply a matter of a father wanting to protect his son from one of Europe's unending conflicts?

436
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 It's an interesting story, either way, though. One is the story of a father's love that's realistic, and his love became legend,

437
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 became the story of talking bears and UFOs, or this man could have actually been a good man on Earth, everybody loved him,

438
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 and some alien race was watching him, watching his good deeds, watching him be the human we all hope to be.

439
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Because if you're going to invite somebody back to your home planet, if you're going to invite somebody into your house,

440
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 don't you want to invite the best of the best?

441
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 No, dude, I'm a gangster, I like, but you hang out with the best gangsters possible, right? You don't hang out with lame gangsters.

442
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Even if you're a bad guy, you want to hang out with the best of the best bad guys.

443
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 So, maybe that was the point.

444
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Maybe the point is to be a good person, to be the best you can possibly be,

445
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 because aliens don't want to take LAMOS back to their planet, they want to take back the ultimate example of human purity and passion.

446
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 That sounded like it was going to be 50 shades of gray aliens, that's not what I was going for.

447
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 There may be an alien planet out there somewhere inhabited by some of the best humanity has to offer,

448
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 because if you were going to abduct somebody, this keeps going sideways, let's see if we can figure out a way to say what I'm trying to say is,

449
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 don't abduct anybody, and if you're going to abduct people, don't abduct the best people, just don't abduct people.

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 What I'm trying to say is, it would make sense for an alien race to not just want to beam anyone back to their planet.

451
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 It would make sense for them to want to beam back the best of the best, and by all accounts, that's who Titu Vare was.

452
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Because even if Titu Vare wasn't abducted by aliens, we're talking about a man who sacrificed everything to keep his son out of a brutal war.

453
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Self-sacrifice is one of the greatest things humans can do, to give up their own life or own freedom for the sake of another.

454
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 That's what our heroes do, and that's what we should try to do every day.

455
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Not every day, because then you die all the time, but you know what I mean.

456
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 We should be giving to others, that's what I'm saying.
