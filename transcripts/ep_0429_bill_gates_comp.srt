1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 A man realizes that the alien encounter doesn't always end when the spaceship leaves.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,000
 And then we take a look at one of the hottest conspiracy theories going around right now.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,600
 Is Super Nerd Bill Gates secretly plotting to take over the planet today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:25,300
 [music]

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,900
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,900
 I'm your host Jason Carbenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,400
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had a great weekend.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,400
 Over the weekend I finished watching Wizards of Waverly Place.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,900
 I had never really seen how the show ended. Very well done.

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,400
 Interesting sitcom because you kind of have to watch it in a linear order.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,400
 If you've never watched Wizards of Waverly Place, I don't know how well it would translate now.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,900
 It's actually really funny and it's magic and witchcraft and...

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,900
 Is it interesting? I recommend checking it out.

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:59,900
 If you watched it before, recheck it out. It's a lighthearted show for these times that we're in.

15
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,900
 And I started watching the show on Hulu called Freakish.

16
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:08,400
 And so far so good. It's a serious zombie television show.

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,900
 I'm really tired of zombie comedies.

18
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:16,400
 It's really hard nowadays to find a straight zombie show and even harder to find a well done one.

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,900
 And even harder to find a television show.

20
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,900
 I mean, you have The Walking Dead spinoffs and the one on Netflix. I can't even remember the name. The one on Syfy Channel.

21
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,900
 But anyway, so I'm watching Freakish right now.

22
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,900
 Now, while I'm watching Freakish, we have people do an important work like Alexander Nestico.

23
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:41,900
 Alexander Nestico is our newest Patreon supporter while I'm sitting down watching Alex Russo try to win the Wizard Competition.

24
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,900
 No spoilers.

25
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,900
 He's out doing the Lord's work by supporting me via Patreon and actually probably doing more productive things in life.

26
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:55,400
 Thank you so much, Alexander. If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just go ahead and get the word out about the show. That helps out a lot.

27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,900
 Alexander, we're going to give you the keys to the Carpentercopter.

28
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,400
 We are headed out to China for this first story.

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:10,400
 The year is 1994. I got this from that thing about it docs.com website. I love so much.

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,400
 Hop in the Carpentercopter. We're leaving behind Waverly Place by Alex by...

31
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,900
 Who are the rest of the dudes? Doesn't matter. That's nothing to do with the plot of this episode.

32
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:27,400
 By Max by... I don't remember the last guy's name. But anyways, we're flying away.

33
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,900
 We're landing near Harbin, China. It's nighttime. It's June 1994.

34
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,900
 So there are these guys. One of them we know the name of.

35
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,900
 Meng Zhaogu. I'm sure I'm terribly mispronouncing that.

36
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:47,400
 Meng Zhaogu. And then there's two other dudes working at a tree farm.

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,900
 I don't know what a tree farm... It's the trees and the little trees are hanging off of them.

38
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:59,900
 It tastes like pine. What's a tree farm? I know Christmas tree farms, but apparently they just harvest trees.

39
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,400
 It's not lumber industry over there. It's just tree farms.

40
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,900
 They're working at a tree farm near Mount Phoenix in China.

41
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,900
 Now they see a strange light up on the mountain.

42
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,900
 So Meng. Meng. And the other two dudes are like, "Hey, let's go check that out.

43
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,400
 Any reason to stop working at a tree farm?" They're like, "We don't even know what we grow here. It's just a forest."

44
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,400
 That's where all they send all the idiots in town. They're like, "Uh, your job's at the tree farm?"

45
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,400
 And they're like, "Oh yeah, great." And they're like, "There'll only be 30, 40 more years until the harvest."

46
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,900
 And they're just standing there looking at trees. The three guys go up in the mountains to find the little...

47
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:45,900
 This is interesting. When they get up there, they see a UFO, but it's not the traditional saucer or cigar shaped or anything.

48
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,900
 It was a ball with a scorpion tail attached to it.

49
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,900
 What? Who's that? It's a sick spaceship, dude.

50
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,900
 All the nerds are flying around in their flying saucers.

51
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,900
 And some dude is like a hot rod, like a 1950s grease lightning UFO.

52
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,900
 It's just a ball with a scorpion tail. That's dope.

53
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,400
 You're all stinging the other ships. They're like, "Ahh! We need perfect balance for us to be able to traverse the cosmos."

54
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,400
 You're like dipping them. They're ending up in prehistoric times.

55
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,400
 Anyways, they're all looking at this really cool, rattledocan spaceship sitting there with the scorpion tail.

56
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,400
 And they keep trying to get close to it, because that's what you're going...

57
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,400
 That's what you do when you see an unidentified flying object with a scorpion tail, right?

58
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,900
 You want to get close to it.

59
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,400
 So these guys, they keep trying to get close to it, but every time they start to, they hear a super high-pitched noise.

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,400
 "Ahh! My ears! Ahhh!"

61
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,900
 Can't do it.

62
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,400
 They end up leaving.

63
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
 Because of... I mean, I...

64
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,400
 And which is funny, because on the one hand you think, like, you would stay...

65
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,400
 You'd be like, "That's dumb. Tree farm or not. Like, that's going to keep growing down there. I don't have to get back to work.

66
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,900
 I'm just going to stay in here."

67
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,400
 But if you don't have a camera...

68
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,900
 Let's say you're in the middle of the woods.

69
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,900
 You come across the glowing orb with the scorpion tail.

70
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,400
 You can't get close to it, otherwise your eardrums explode.

71
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,400
 You have no camera, no nothing. How long would you stand there?

72
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,400
 And that's an interesting question, because I think instinctually we would say, "Oh, we would just keep standing there."

73
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,400
 But at the same time, two hours later, it's just like, "Woo-woah, it's just glowing there. It looks cool."

74
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,400
 But eventually you're going to be like, "This is boring, right? Nothing's happening. It's just sitting there."

75
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
 So after a point in time, you would go home.

76
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,900
 The next day, though, Mong and his buddies return.

77
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,900
 And this time, it's still sitting there.

78
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,900
 They're like, "I'm glad I didn't wait here all night. Ugh."

79
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,900
 I would have been super-boring, even bring a book.

80
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,900
 They're reading communion. They're like, super-scared.

81
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,900
 This time, though, they didn't get super-close to it.

82
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,900
 They get close enough.

83
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,900
 Mong breaks out his binoculars.

84
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,900
 Then he's looking at the thing and the little shuttle, little door opens up.

85
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,900
 Pssshhhh.

86
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,400
 And there's a dude. He doesn't describe what the alien looks like.

87
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,400
 But there's a dude. Walks down. He's standing next to the spacecraft.

88
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,400
 And then something shoots like a blue beam.

89
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,400
 Appears out of the spacecraft, hits Mong in the head.

90
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
 Whoa!

91
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
 Passes out.

92
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
 Next thing he knows, he's on a train.

93
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:43,400
 Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch

94
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:50,400
 He probably would have run out of gas before it got to you.

95
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,400
 This story basically has two scary endings.

96
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,900
 This was reported in Fate magazine.

97
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,900
 There's September 1997 issue.

98
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,900
 It has two scary endings.

99
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,900
 One, Mong wakes up and he's being treated because he fainted and they don't know what's wrong with him.

100
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,900
 Now, the people who get him medical attention, they had seen it as well.

101
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,900
 So it's not like they just found him in the middle of nowhere, right?

102
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,400
 They're like, "Yeah, he was looking at this UFO through binoculars."

103
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
 Next thing you know, he passes out.

104
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,400
 Yeah, we're gonna call an ambulance. He doesn't just have low blood sugar.

105
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,400
 Which you should also call an ambulance or a trainulence for low blood sugar.

106
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,900
 But anyways, we're all on this train now.

107
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,400
 And Mong wakes up.

108
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,400
 The medical personnel is like, "Oh, are you okay? Are you okay?"

109
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,400
 Actually, I don't think the medical personnel was on the train.

110
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,900
 I think the train was taking him to the hospital.

111
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,900
 It didn't just happen to be a train full of doctors.

112
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,900
 He wakes up. That's even scarier because then he definitely is not getting any help.

113
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,900
 He wakes up. Just normal people are around him.

114
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,900
 "Where's the doctors? I just had this fever dream. I was surrounded by doctors."

115
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,900
 They're like, "No, no. Calm down, Mong."

116
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,900
 What happens is he wakes up. Let's get to the actual story here.

117
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,400
 He does wake up and there's buddies are talking to him.

118
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:08,400
 But right past where his buddies were, he sees a terrifying-looking female alien...

119
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,400
 [Growling]

120
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
 ...standing in the train.

121
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
 [Growling]

122
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,400
 And he freaks out, "Oh my god, oh my god!" Everyone turns around.

123
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,400
 It's empty.

124
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,900
 There's nothing there, Mong. There's nothing there.

125
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,900
 No, I saw her. She was this hideous, scary-looking alien.

126
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,400
 It was a girl, too. I just have to add that in because it makes it scarier.

127
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,400
 There's nothing there, Mong. You're just having a flashback.

128
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:44,400
 He then begins to see corner of his eye down a dark hallway,

129
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:51,400
 standing right behind you, a terrifying, horrible-looking alien...

130
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,400
 [Growling]

131
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
 ...haunting him.

132
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,900
 Now that's creepy, right? Just the idea of one...

133
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,900
 Like getting shot with an alien laser beam, whatever.

134
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,900
 That happens a lot in UFO-ology and they usually just go, "Oh, they get up and the UFO's gone."

135
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,900
 It could be a skeptic who goes, "Someone had a seizure and the brain worked backwards."

136
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:19,900
 So you basically had a seizure and then your brain recreated the series of events before you fell down.

137
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,900
 So you fall down, you have a seizure, you fall down, and then your brain remembers an alien shooting you with a beam.

138
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,400
 It creates the whole thing to kind of give it some sort of sense, or it's just like dreams.

139
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,900
 They're fiery neurons. That's a skeptical outlook on all this stuff.

140
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,400
 The other two dudes, they weren't having seizures. Everyone saw the scorpion-shaped ship.

141
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,400
 But anyways, that's creepy. The fact that now it's almost like a ghost.

142
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,400
 It's like a grudge or a samara where he's sitting there eating soup on a train, his hands shaking.

143
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
 Spooned. [Growling]

144
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,400
 Soups going everywhere. The people next to him are all moving.

145
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,400
 They're like, "Trauma or not. You're a mess."

146
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,900
 And then seeing peeking above the seat.

147
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,400
 [Growling]

148
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,900
 He described it as a, quote, "scary-looking female alien."

149
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,900
 I'm turning it into basically one of the ghosts from "13 Ghosts."

150
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,400
 It's like, "Arrrrr."

151
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,900
 But whatever. The fact is that scary-looking is scary-looking.

152
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,400
 And this thing followed him around for who knows how long.

153
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:25,900
 Now, that's scary, because again, what we're a social species, and it's not just meaning we want to talk to people and hug each other and like hold hands.

154
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,900
 We know as a species we're fairly weak. We're the smartest species.

155
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,900
 As far as we know, we're the smartest species in the galaxy.

156
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:40,900
 We're definitely the smartest on this planet or in the solar system, but we're physically weak for the most part.

157
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,900
 Like, lions and bears and stuff like that. A giant sloth. Those things can all wreck us.

158
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,400
 So, part of being a social species, we band together for protection.

159
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,400
 So, when you--that's why stories where people are isolated are kind of scary.

160
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,400
 You know, a woman trapped in a apartment all by herself.

161
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,400
 And that's basically--that's basically everybody right now.

162
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,400
 But you know what I mean? Like, it's one thing to have a person in peril.

163
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:14,400
 It's another thing, and that's scary enough, but if you're in a group of people and nobody else can perceive the threat, that's even scarier to us.

164
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:21,400
 That is a scarier image. So, the fact that he's on a train full of people, but only he can see the threat.

165
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:32,400
 Only he can see the terrifying image of this female alien, which I personally imagine horribly hideous monstrous face, the body of Kate Upton.

166
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,400
 That's just my impression of this--AHHHHH!

167
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,900
 And then just very, very curvy, voluptuous woman.

168
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,400
 But your mileage may vary on that. You might want to make the whole body spooky, whatever.

169
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,400
 But whatever. The threat's there, and only he can realize it.

170
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:52,400
 The other scary thing--so that's a scary thing, because we don't know how long it went on for, even if it only went on for five minutes.

171
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
 It's still terrifying.

172
00:11:53,400 --> 00:12:01,400
 But I think another scary thing about this story, though--I said there were two scary things--is that if this story took place in the United States in 1994,

173
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,400
 it would probably be--maybe he'd be on Jenny Jones talking about it.

174
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,400
 Maybe he would--that's an old talk show.

175
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:17,400
 That was a talk show that actually got cancelled, because Jenny Jones did this thing where it was like, "Your secret crush!"

176
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
 This is 100% real.

177
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,400
 Jenny Jones was a super famous talk show host.

178
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
 She had this episode where she--and I don't think they ever aired it.

179
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,400
 Talk about Lost Media. I don't believe they ever aired it, but they might have.

180
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:35,400
 They had this special--she had this show on. It was like a Dr. Phil--not even Dr. Phil. It was like a--anyway, it was a daytime talk show, right?

181
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,400
 And they were always looking for gimmicks and stuff like that.

182
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,400
 She said, "Meet your secret crush!"

183
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
 So they invite this guy onto the show.

184
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
 They do time television.

185
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
 Invite this guy onto the show.

186
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
 1990s as well.

187
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,400
 I don't know if it--I don't think it would fly that well today either, but--fights this guy on her show.

188
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,400
 And then they're like, "You have a secret admirer in the audience!"

189
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
 It's like, "Woo!"

190
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,400
 And then Jenny Jones goes, "Let's bring your secret admirer out!"

191
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:07,400
 And then the side door opens up and the secret admirer comes out and it's his neighbor, his male neighbor.

192
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,400
 And the neighbor was gay and was like, "I have a crush on you!"

193
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
 Woo!

194
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:18,400
 Audience--and the dude, like maybe like a couple weeks after that was filmed, walked over to his neighbor's house and shot him to death.

195
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
 Murdered him.

196
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:26,400
 So I don't know if they ever aired that episode. I don't think he--I don't think the guy who did it--I don't think the murderer was like,

197
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:33,400
 "Oh, that was embarrassing. I'm just gonna wait until they air it and then commit a murder. I'm pretty sure he murdered him and they never aired the episode.

198
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
 I'll see if I can double check that for that on show notes."

199
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
 But what am I--Oh yeah, yes!

200
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,400
 Anyways, so if you saw an alien in America in the 90s, he'd be in the new--maybe local newspaper.

201
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
 Maybe.

202
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:52,400
 Like, you know, in China--and we talked about this in the Soviet Union, they had a big--basically if you saw UFOs in the Soviet Union,

203
00:13:52,400 --> 00:14:00,400
 you did not report them, because the KGB would come and "question you," which generally involved you being dragged into a dark room.

204
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
 China, pretty much the same thing.

205
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:12,400
 So, the fact that this guy, this poor tree harvester, who saw UFO, had this really close encounter--are they close enough to hear it,

206
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
 if they were being like repelled by some sort of weapon?

207
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,400
 Then he's attacked by one and now he's still in contact. He's still able to see this female alien.

208
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,400
 That dude's in a dungeon somewhere.

209
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:30,400
 I mean, that--it would be the difference between reporting a UFO if you were in the middle of Kansas versus reporting a UFO

210
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,400
 if you were in the middle of Kansas, circa 1600s.

211
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,400
 One of them are going to be like, "Oh, he saw a UFO." That's interesting.

212
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,400
 The other side, they're going to burn you as a witch.

213
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:50,400
 So, you may--depending on where you're at and what time period you're in, you may not want to go around telling people you saw a really cool, scorpion-shaped UFO.

214
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:58,400
 But anyways, so, two scary indians. One haunted by a female ghost alien, however you want to call it, I call it ghost.

215
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:05,400
 And then two basically, probably disappeared somewhere into--I said maybe he was eventually released.

216
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:12,400
 But imagine if you thought being trapped on a train with a distorted looking, horrible female alien from the head up.

217
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,400
 Imagine being stuck in a dark cell with one in some sort of government facility underneath a mountain.

218
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:24,400
 Although now that I say that if just her face is horrifying and it's pitch black, I'm down. I can do that.

219
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,400
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next topic.

220
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:33,400
 But Alexander, let's fire up that carbonicopter. We're leaving. Let's rescue Mong from prison actually first.

221
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
 I'm going to use my massive strength.

222
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
 [Mong growling]

223
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,400
 That was me ripping the bars off the cell wall.

224
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,400
 "All of you are free! Leave!" They're like, "Yeah, yeah."

225
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,400
 And Alexander puts his hand on my shoulder and goes, "Jason."

226
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,400
 "It was the wrong prison, dude. That was the prison of the cannibals."

227
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,400
 I'm like, "Oh no! Go to the other--don't rescue--don't stop those guys. Those guys invade a town. Go to the other prison."

228
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,400
 "You're free!" And then Mong escapes.

229
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,400
 We're hopping on the carbonicopter. Alexander fire up that whirly bird.

230
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,400
 I just recorded a 40 minute segment on whether or not-- [laughs]

231
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,400
 On whether or not Bill Gates is the Antichrist. You know it's fine. I'm not going to air it.

232
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,400
 It's so dense. It's so dense. Let me go over the points real quick,

233
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
 because I know I'm going to get emails about this for the next month.

234
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,400
 That way, at least I can say I addressed it. I'm going to go over this as quickly as I can.

235
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
 We'll move on to the next story.

236
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:29,400
 Basically, Bill Gates is having the worst month I've ever seen a celebrity have since O.J. Simpson.

237
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:34,400
 It all started back in 2016. There was a website called Your Newswire.

238
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:40,400
 I think they're changed to, like, News Punch or News Max or News Need of the Growing or something like that.

239
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,400
 Anyways, they ran a headline, "Bill Gates admits, quote, vaccines are the best way to depopulate,"

240
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:51,400
 because Bill Gates said that using vaccines can actually help reduce population growth.

241
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:57,400
 And so the anti-vax movement really took that and said, "Oh, he's using the vaccines to sterilize kids in Africa

242
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,400
 or the vaccines are killing people, giving people autism," all that's up.

243
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,400
 And that was-- he was basically-- I didn't know this. He was an enemy of the anti-vaxxers for a long time.

244
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,400
 I'm not a fan of Bill Gates. I don't hate him. He's just kind of one of those figures

245
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,400
 that I'm aware exists. I don't really pay much attention to him. What happened was--

246
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,400
 and he said-- because someone asked him to clarify that comment, and back in 2011,

247
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,400
 he said that to CNN. Later, he was doing an interview with Forbes, and he said,

248
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,400
 "This kind of makes sense. If you vaccinate kids, less kids die, so families have less kids.

249
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,400
 If you have eight-- basically, you'll have eight kids in your family to work the land

250
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,400
 because you're going to lose three to five of them.

251
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,400
 But if you know your kids are going to live, you're only going to have four kids.

252
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,400
 People don't want to have big families. They have big families so they can work the land.

253
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
 You don't know who's going to die." So that was the logic behind that.

254
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,400
 But anyways, the anti-vaxxers said he was trying to sterilize everyone.

255
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,400
 I'm going to go over these next ones as quickly as I can. It's so bizarre.

256
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,400
 Again, original version, 40 minutes long. Here we go. Coronavirus hits.

257
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,400
 Everyone gets locked inside their house, giant molecules are walking down the street,

258
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,400
 punching people, crawling their lungs, making them sick.

259
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,400
 Bill Gates comes out and does an AMA on the coronavirus.

260
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,400
 And I remember at the time thinking, "Okay, when's Hillary Duff's AMA on the coronavirus?"

261
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,400
 Like, I don't care what Bill Gates has to say about this,

262
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,400
 but I didn't know he was doing a bunch of work in vaccines.

263
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:23,400
 So anyways, he says in the AMA that eventually they may have something like digital vaccination records.

264
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,400
 So you can tell who can go to work, who's had the disease, who hasn't.

265
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,400
 Conspiracy theory community spearheaded by the anti-vaxx movement jumped all over this.

266
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,400
 First off, they pointed to a patent he held, his company held, for a quantum tattoo,

267
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,400
 which sounds like the name of a really crappy band.

268
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:47,400
 But anyways, quantum tattoo is an invisible tattoo that can only be seen with a QR reader on a phone.

269
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,400
 It lasts for five years. The theory was you'd give it to kids,

270
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,400
 and then by the time they're five, they should have other records anyways.

271
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
 That's why it doesn't last that long.

272
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,400
 Conspiracy theorists go, "Mark of the beast! He's telling us to be able to work again

273
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,400
 to make money to buy and sell. We're going to have to have a mark on our hand."

274
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
 That's invisible. Mark of the beast.

275
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,400
 Mark of the beast is something that the Antichrist uses in the book of Revelation.

276
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,400
 And since the '70s, there's-- I've talked about this quite a lot on the show.

277
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,400
 Since the '70s, really, there's been a big push of what the mark of the beast could be.

278
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,400
 Was it a microchip? Was it a barcode? Now it's a QR code.

279
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,400
 Speaking of microchips, first off, the conspiracy theory was we'd get a tattoo on our hand

280
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,400
 to show that we've been vaccinated so we could go back to work.

281
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,400
 And then within a matter of days, it became-- No, no, no, no, no, because that's not sci-fi enough.

282
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
 See, that is possible.

283
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,400
 What happens is you have conspiracy theories that have a plausible answer,

284
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,400
 not even a skeptical answer, like have a plausible answer,

285
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,400
 and then some lunatic goes, "Give me that!" and they run and they jump off a cliff.

286
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,400
 Pizzagate, a pedophile code hidden in the Podesta emails.

287
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
 There's definitely a code hidden in the Podesta emails.

288
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
 What it refers to? Does it refer to pedophilia?

289
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,400
 That's your leap of logic. Looks like it does, honestly.

290
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,400
 The grabbing it and running and jumping off the cliff is, "Hillary Clinton needs babies!"

291
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,400
 Like, that is such a bizarre leap of logic.

292
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,400
 There's a code in these emails. Could refer to drug smuggling. Could refer to money laundering.

293
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,400
 Could refer to pedophilia. You know, that would be the grossest answer, right?

294
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,400
 Anyways, someone goes, "Yeah, Bill Gates has this thing for this digital tattoo that we could all get."

295
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,400
 No, he's gonna microchip us! Ah!

296
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,400
 I've had people email me and comment on my videos that we're getting microchipped by Bill Gates' vaccine.

297
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,400
 So, people make that leap of logic super fast.

298
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
 But anyway, so there's that thing.

299
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,400
 So basically, first he's getting tied into depopulating the planet via vaccines,

300
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,400
 then he's being tied into creating the Mark of the Beast.

301
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:45,400
 A couple weeks after that, Roger Stone, political operative, knows the ins and outs and the dark corridors all over Washington, DC.

302
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,400
 He's doing an interview with Joe Piscopal on the radio, and he accuses...

303
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,400
 Well, to be fair, he does the thing where he's saying,

304
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,400
 "Well, I'm not saying," he said it, "but somebody is."

305
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:09,400
 He's making the claim that friends of his believe that Bill Gates either engineered the virus himself, or he's spreading the virus.

306
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,400
 And the thing is, Roger Stone basically goes back and says,

307
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,400
 "He and other globalists are using it for mandatory vaccinations and microchipping."

308
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,400
 So we get back into this idea of Mark of the Beast having this thing, government control and stuff like that.

309
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,400
 Okay, so now you have highlighted...

310
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
 First off, you have people on the internet being like,

311
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,400
 "But you're gonna get the microchip if you get the needle in your arm," which is Battlestar Galactica-level technology.

312
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,400
 Digital tattoo, the patent for that exists, that can be done.

313
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:41,400
 I don't know why conspiracy theorists feel the need to go to the most extreme thing all the time.

314
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
 And we get to that later on.

315
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,400
 So basically, within a month, he goes from talking about, "We should need digital vaccination records,"

316
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
 which would never fly in the United States.

317
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,400
 You're never gonna have a point where, for me to leave my house to go shopping, I have to show someone my papers.

318
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
 That's just not gonna fly.

319
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,400
 But anyways, we have a hard enough time having people show their ID when they go to apply for a job.

320
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,400
 There's still people complaining about that, like, that you need to show proof that you are a U.S. citizen.

321
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,400
 People still complain about that, let alone me going to Walmart and having to show my birth certificate

322
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,400
 or hold my hand out so they can scan it.

323
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
 It's not gonna happen.

324
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
 Not in the United States, at least.

325
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,400
 I can't say, you know, Britain has a very weird police state apparatus over there.

326
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:27,400
 But anyways, then, speaking of Pizzagate, speaking of the Podesta emails,

327
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
 I mean, the worst month possible.

328
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:36,400
 So then, Microsoft, out of all the possible options for celebrities to hire to advertise a product,

329
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:45,400
 they get Marina Abramovich, who is the artist behind the spirit cooking.

330
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
 She was specifically mentioned in the Podesta emails.

331
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,400
 She has been a target of conspiracy theorists for a long, long time.

332
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:56,400
 She says, "Listen, I'm just a performance artist and art. We do all sorts of stuff.

333
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,400
 Yes, I have this weird imagery in it, but I am not a saying worshiper.

334
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
 I'm not a saying worshiper.

335
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,400
 I do use this imagery, and if you read my memoirs, you would understand,

336
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
 it comes from a place of spirituality.

337
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
 I'm not a saying worshiper."

338
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,400
 Other people say that's 100% saying worshipping.

339
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,400
 She is possibly this black dude that was in the background of one of her photos was found

340
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,400
 and dead in the desert with his eyeballs pecked out.

341
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,400
 Like, some people, again, that's a leap of logic.

342
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,400
 You could argue, well, I just think that's distasteful art,

343
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,400
 and I think you're using this imagery of cannibalism and this imagery of dark stuff.

344
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
 And I don't like it.

345
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
 I don't like that type of art.

346
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
 That's a plausible thing to say.

347
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,400
 It's another thing to say, "Oh, here's a picture of a black guy,

348
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,400
 and here's a picture of another black guy, but that guy got his eyeballs ripped out.

349
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
 Therefore, it's the same dude."

350
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,400
 The leaps of law, it's always these leaps of logic,

351
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,400
 but anyways, so Microsoft gets this woman who, that a good percentage of the population,

352
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,400
 I'd say maybe 10%, 15%, believes she is a Satan worshipping witch who's high connected.

353
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
 And she is hanging out with celebrities and all this stuff.

354
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,400
 She's like 73 years old, super successful artist.

355
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:06,400
 They get her to do an ad for one of their products, and the ad is almost immediately taken down.

356
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,400
 I think it got like 25,000 down votes in the first day or two, like immediately dropped.

357
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
 Immediately dropped.

358
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,400
 It was this ad campaign for this new thing called the HoloLens, too.

359
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
 It's augmented reality.

360
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,400
 It's mixed reality, so you can kind of see, but then Marina Abramovich would kind of walk around in your living room,

361
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:29,400
 which, I mean, dude, just the timing of it was so bad, but the conspiracy theorists say,

362
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,400
 "No, it's supposed to be Easter weekend, so he's embracing his satanic roots and all this stuff."

363
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
 Whatever.

364
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
 I don't know, right?

365
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
 That's the thing that I have to say about this stuff.

366
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
 I don't know if Bill Gates is some dark occult lord.

367
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
 I hope he's not, right?

368
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:46,400
 But there's just stumble after stumble after stumble, and then this all culminated

369
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,400
 in probably about the past 48 hours.

370
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
 This is really where this topped out at.

371
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,400
 Man, this version's going way quicker than the 40 minute version.

372
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
 This was found, I think, about a day or two ago.

373
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
 There is a patent.

374
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,400
 Patent is W0 2020-- No, this is true.

375
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
 This is real.

376
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,400
 W0 2020 060606.

377
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,400
 So basically, patent 666.

378
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,400
 Other people have said WO stands for World Order.

379
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:22,400
 2020 is obviously the year, but what's weird is that the patent was submitted back in 2019.

380
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,400
 So I guess it's when it gets approved, or maybe the 2020 is just coincidence.

381
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:30,400
 But anyway, 060606 is what everyone's dialing in on.

382
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
 666, obviously.

383
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
 This is weird.

384
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
 This is weird.

385
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,400
 But again, a conspiracy theorist, "Give me that!" and run and jump off a cliff with it.

386
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,400
 It is a real patent, and I don't know a lot about bitcoin mining,

387
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,400
 but basically, bitcoin virtual currency.

388
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
 You have a computer.

389
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,400
 Basically, they have to have a fixed amount of it,

390
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,400
 but they also have this weird thing where you mine it to earn it.

391
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,400
 So it still gives it a little bit like how you have to mine gold.

392
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
 You have computers that are constantly running computations.

393
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
 You can buy all these high-end graphic cards.

394
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
 You're constantly running computations,

395
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
 and you're doing all this math work,

396
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,400
 and then you're rewarded with tiny, tiny bits of bitcoin, like you're mining,

397
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,400
 like you were mining gold nuggets.

398
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:22,400
 Patent W02020060606 is to turn the human body into a bitmining computer.

399
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,400
 So every movement of your head, every brain wave, every drop of sweat coming out of your pores,

400
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
 this is real.

401
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,400
 I don't know how feasible it is, but the patent is real.

402
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,400
 You would basically be able to turn your body into,

403
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:43,400
 and they said that human body, all of the stuff doing it is far more complex than the computer running the thing,

404
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
 running the bitmining thing.

405
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
 The body's constantly doing something,

406
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,400
 whether it's releasing gas or tensing a muscle or something like that.

407
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,400
 Turn the human body into a bitcoin mining machine.

408
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
 Links in the show notes.

409
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,400
 You guys who are more technically savvy can go look at that,

410
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
 but anyways, we got that.

411
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
 So that's weird, right?

412
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,400
 666, the human body's related to currency.

413
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,400
 That was always the thing in the Bible.

414
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,400
 The number of the beast, the 666, that's up for debate.

415
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
 Everything's up for debate in the book of Revelation.

416
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,400
 But anyways, you're linking the human body to currency and stuff like that.

417
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,400
 That's fascinating again enough that someone would, one, figure that out to the quote/unquote coincidence

418
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,400
 that it's patent number 0600606.

419
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,400
 But then as people are discussing what this is, someone puts forth,

420
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:34,400
 "Oh my God, what they'll do is they'll just take people and trap them in boxes and torture them.

421
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,400
 And they'll torture them and it will just make their body constantly do computation to mine bitcoins.

422
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
 Oh my God, the world is so evil."

423
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
 What? No.

424
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,400
 Within the same thread where people are talking about this,

425
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,400
 the most insane version of the--

426
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,400
 That wasn't in the patent.

427
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,400
 The patent didn't show a dude locked in a box like banging on it as like guys were poking him.

428
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,400
 You could be sleeping and your body's running these things.

429
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
 Walking down the street, your body's running these things.

430
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
 Blinking, your body's running all these computations.

431
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,400
 Little mechanism either attached to you, inside you, however, reads you.

432
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:14,400
 Immediately gets turned into, "Oh my God, the new world order wants to lock us all in boxes and torture us 24/7 to mine bitcoin."

433
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:21,400
 That's what fascinates me about these conspiracy theories is how quickly they morph.

434
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,400
 How quickly they change.

435
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:30,400
 Within one month, Bill Gates went from being someone who's not even on my radar

436
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,400
 to now-- He'll never return to normal.

437
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:40,400
 From now on, he's a George Soros level threat to the conspiracy community.

438
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,400
 He'll never be able to backtrack.

439
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,400
 Which I mean, he could be like, "I don't care. I'm gonna go Scrooge McDuck swim in my money."

440
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:54,400
 But, I mean, within a month, he went from being a guy that I was again vaguely aware of.

441
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
 I saw him in an airport.

442
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,400
 I might not even tell anybody that I saw Bill Gates at the airport.

443
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,400
 To somebody who is just constantly popping up in the stuff.

444
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:09,400
 And the conspiracy theorists would say, "He's constantly popping up in the stuff because he's actually doing these things."

445
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,400
 I just think he's had a really bad month.

446
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,400
 Again, I don't know. I don't know.

447
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,400
 I think right now, a lot of people are tying a lot of this stuff into the occult.

448
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,400
 I think that the coronavirus has opened up a gateway, not a supernatural gateway.

449
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,400
 But there are a lot of people who are trying to figure out a way to make a lot of money off of this.

450
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,400
 And there are an equal amount of people who are trying to find out a way to consolidate their power because of this.

451
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,400
 People are using this opportunity to make money and consolidate power.

452
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,400
 Absolutely. Absolutely. And I don't think Bill Gates is above that.

453
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,400
 I think just because he started off as a nerd, doesn't make him any less power hungry than anybody else.

454
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,400
 Everybody wants to change the world in their vision, including you.

455
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,400
 Including me. We just don't have the means to really do it.

456
00:29:52,400 --> 00:30:00,400
 Obviously, if I was the richest man in the world, I'd be doing stuff that I would be affecting the world in a way that I would want it to be.

457
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:07,400
 And I would find like-minded people who are just as powerful as me to figure out a way to go, "This is the way we want the world to be."

458
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,400
 We want the world to be fit and healthy.

459
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,400
 We want the world to focus on fitness.

460
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,400
 So I would be funding groups that did that.

461
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:24,400
 I'd be opening gyms. I would be funding youth sports groups and adult sports groups.

462
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,400
 And I would be with other people that celebrated that stuff.

463
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,400
 And we would be pushing that.

464
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,400
 That is basically- and I think that is more likely- not the fitness thing.

465
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:39,400
 I mean, I am a fan of fitness. I think it's very, very important to be fit, especially in the wake of this disease going around.

466
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,400
 But you have- that's what I've always thought.

467
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,400
 I've never thought that there was one unique illuminati that controlled the world.

468
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,400
 You instead have hundreds of smaller groups, each trying to affect the world in their some way.

469
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:56,400
 And sometimes they clash, sometimes they work together, but for the most part they're separate.

470
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,400
 And that's just been my view on it.

471
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,400
 This is why my episode was 40 minutes long.

472
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,400
 That has- so I think Bill Gates is trying to affect the world in the way that he sees fit.

473
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,400
 I don't necessarily think he's trying to depopulate the planet.

474
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
 I just think he's had a really, really bad month.

475
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:17,400
 Could be wrong, could be wrong, but, you know, there would be much-

476
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:24,400
 there would be much easier ways for a guy who invented the most popular operating system in the history of the world to depopulate the planet.

477
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,400
 I.e., trigger something in windows so they all shut off at the exact same time.

478
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
 The economy would collapse like that.

479
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,400
 You'd have air traffic control towers that were using old copies of Windows 95.

480
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,400
 Everything shut- that's the way you depopulate the planet, right?

481
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,400
 I don't know why you'd have to invent something new when he already has a doomsday weapon built,

482
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,400
 and that's that every company uses- most of them- uses Windows, some version of Windows.

483
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,400
 All those Windows servers shutting down at the same time.

484
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
 That would be the end of the world.

485
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,400
 There'd be no way to recover, 'cause definitely, I could tell you this right now.

486
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,400
 You could have mutant, irradiated dogs chasing me down the street,

487
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,400
 asteroids flying down in an alien drop ship, finally reaching Earth.

488
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
 I'm not using a Macintosh.

489
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,400
 You gotta pull teeth to get me to sit down in front of a Mac.

490
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:15,400
 So if he really wanted in the world, he could do it literally with the push of a button.

491
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,400
 But again, I'm so ambivalent towards Bill Gates.

492
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,400
 I find the conspiracy theories absolutely interesting,

493
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,400
 and he'll be on- I mean, like, I'll be aware of him probably more now, 'cause I'll sing him pop up,

494
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,400
 but again, if I saw Bill Gates walking down the street,

495
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,400
 I probably wouldn't even mention it on my show.

496
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
 Unless!

497
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,400
 I saw him walking down the street, and then he kinda looked side to side,

498
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
 and he didn't see anyone, I'm like, hiding in the bushes,

499
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,400
 and then he pulls out a giant hypodermic needle,

500
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,400
 and I see him walking towards your house, and he, like, opens the window.

501
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
 [grunt]

502
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
 He starts to crawl inside.

503
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,400
 Then I might mention it on my show.

504
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,400
 If I say, "Hey, guys, did you wake up yesterday with a big red lump on your butt?"

505
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,400
 Um, yes, Bill Gates just irradiated you.

506
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
 Sorry.

507
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,400
 I might, but I may just forget as well, so...

508
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,400
