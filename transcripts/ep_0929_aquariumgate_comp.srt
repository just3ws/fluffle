1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,680
 Can a demonic possession happen so fast that one minute you're in the kitchen chopping vegetables?

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,640
 And the next minute you're running through your house stabbing your loved ones in the

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,640
 throat.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,960
 Welcome back to new episodes, and then we take a look at one of the newest conspiracy

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,120
 theories popping up right now, one that the internet overlords are trying their best to

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,960
 suppress.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:33,680
 Is it possible that aquariums across the United States are actually fronts for child trafficking

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,960
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:47,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,720
 I'm your host Jason Garminer, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,720
 day too.

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,920
 I had a great vacation and I hope you guys had a great vacation too.

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,400
 I worked the entire time you were off, but whatever you did over the last couple weeks

00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,160
 I hope you had a lot of fun doing it.

 Now Barking Bunny, let's go ahead and pick you up and scratch your little belly and then

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,920
 we're going to toss you into the driver's seat of the Jason Jalopy.

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,520
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command, we're going to drive all the way out to Stewart's

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,040
 Town, Pennsylvania.

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,200
 We're headed out to Stewart's Town, Pennsylvania.

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,920
 It's August 22nd, 2022, it's an incredibly recent story that's going on here and quite

28
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,280
 chilling, quite a spooky story.

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,240
 We're going to start this off in the basement of a sleepy little house on Firebox Court

30
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,400
 in Stewart Town, Pennsylvania.

31
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,440
 You're like, "Oh no, I live on that street."

32
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,400
 Well, I'm sure you are, you're about this story if you lived here, you're not like,

33
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,080
 "Oh, I wonder what all those police cars are doing in my neighborhood."

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,840
 Better listen to this paranormal podcast.

35
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,840
 We're at the home of the Fosec family.

36
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
 It's 7.30 PM.

37
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:28,440
 And in the basement, this is a weird house, the story not inwithstanding, the layout

38
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,840
 of this house is weird.

39
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,760
 Apparently, these people prepare their dinner in the basement of the house.

40
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,120
 That should be red flag number one if someone ever says that you want something to eat and

41
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
 you're like, "Yeah, sure."

42
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,440
 And they walk into their spooky basement, something bad's about to happen.

43
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,200
 But anyways, I guess back in the old times, all the food was in the basement, right?

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,320
 They had root cellars, so if someone's like, "Hey, who wants some celery?"

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,800
 We're like, "Nobody's celery's disgusting."

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,720
 And the guy's like, "I'll be right back."

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,560
 And you go down and you dig through your root cellar, you're digging up vegetables and stuff

48
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
 like that.

49
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,880
 But anyways, there's this dude named Keith Kretzer.

50
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,720
 He's 32-year-old man and he's chopping vegetables in the basement.

51
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,920
 Chopping, chop, chop, chop, he's digging up carrots with his bare hands.

52
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,440
 And also in the basement is his girlfriend, Christine Fusec.

53
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,720
 She's 34-years-old and also her five-year-old daughter, Riley Reynolds, is in the basement

54
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,640
 as well and they're watching.

55
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,080
 Keith prepared this little meal.

56
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,800
 He's like flipping carrots up in the air.

57
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,080
 He's singing that song from the Little Mermaid.

58
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,000
 Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,680
 As he's cutting this, as he's cutting these vegetables up and stuff like that, to be completely

60
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,360
 fair, I just think that made notes.

61
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,800
 There's no mention of vegetables in all of this story.

62
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,720
 Actually what happens is now that I look down, now that I read my notes a little bit

63
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,720
 clearer, he's in the kitchen.

64
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,360
 He is in the basement preparing dinner.

65
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,280
 You're still just scratching your head and you're like, "Jason, people don't prepare

66
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,800
 food in the basement."

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,120
 He is in the basement with Christine and Riley.

68
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,360
 He's preparing dinner and then all of a sudden he feels like something took him over.

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,880
 He feels like this force outside of his own consciousness entered his body.

70
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,920
 And at this point, whether or not he was chopping vegetables and singing a jaunty tune or not,

71
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:17,160
 he does grab a knife from the food preparation area and turns to face his girlfriend and

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,000
 begins stabbing her to death.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Stabbing her, right?

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,880
 And then he turns to the five-year-old daughter and begins stabbing her to death too.

75
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,880
 I'm not going to do sound effects for that one.

76
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,360
 Even I know there's a limit.

77
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,280
 Even I know that's quite grim.

78
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,560
 Then he runs upstairs.

79
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,520
 Now, they're not alone in the house.

80
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
 They're just in the basement.

81
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,840
 This is a two-story house, not including the basement.

82
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,880
 He runs upstairs and on the first floor is Christine's...

83
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,160
 It doesn't specifically say it's her mom, but Jacqueline Fusek.

84
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,960
 She's 63 years old, so mom, grandma, I'm not for sure.

85
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,760
 Keith runs into the living room and he has this knife and he begins to stab Jacqueline.

86
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
 She...

87
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,760
 Ah!

88
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
 Stop it!

89
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
 Stop it!

90
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
 Stop it!

91
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
 Stop it!

92
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,760
 Ugh!

93
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,760
 Okay, I'll stabbing her up.

94
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
 Stabbing her like in the head...

95
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
 That's difficult, right?

96
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
 Because you've got that big old skull, right?

97
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,000
 You're going to stab someone in the skull.

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,800
 Well, he doesn't stop there because he begins stabbing her in the neck and in the torso.

99
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,520
 So she's now laying on the couch bleeding out.

100
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,240
 And there's one more person in the house.

101
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,040
 On the second floor of the house, there's Joseph Fusek.

102
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:31,240
 Now, he, like many of us have done many times before, is playing a video game with his headphones

103
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
 on.

104
00:05:32,240 --> 00:06:02,240
 Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-

105
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,680
 He's in a gaming chair completely shocked about what's going on when Keith runs in and

106
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
 starts stabbing him.

107
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,680
 Ah!

108
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,760
 Stabbing him and stuff like that.

109
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,840
 But Joseph is able to kind of get the drop on Keith.

110
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:19,440
 They begin fighting over the knife and eventually, Joseph gets the knife away from Keith.

111
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,920
 And at this point, Keith says, "Whatever was controlling me, whatever entered my body

112
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,520
 in the basement, left.

113
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,920
 The minute the knife was removed from my hand, I suddenly felt like I was in control again."

114
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,920
 He said he stepped back and he looked and he saw that his hands were covered in cuts.

115
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,120
 Using a kitchen knife, there's a little tip, using a kitchen knife is a really bad way

116
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,040
 to murder somebody or to assault somebody because they're not built to be covered in

117
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
 blood.

118
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:56,160
 When you stab someone with a combat knife, you're going to get your hand slippery, right?

119
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,120
 But when you're stabbing someone with a good hilt, some serial killers taking notes, he's

120
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,000
 driving a car with a victim in his trunk.

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,840
 When you stab someone with a knife designed to stab people, you can still keep a good

122
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,000
 grip of it.

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,480
 But when you stab someone with a steak knife, when you stab someone with a knife that's

124
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:17,720
 used for cutting vegetables, what happens is I stab you, the knife is now covered in

125
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:24,960
 blood and the next stab or the next swipe, my hand is actually going to move up the blade

126
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
 and I'll cut myself.

127
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:32,280
 It's very, very common to cut yourself while you're using a steak knife to murder people

128
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,840
 or to fight people.

129
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,360
 So that's what happened with this dude, right?

130
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,600
 He stabbed three people already and he was stabbing Joseph and the knife was sliding

131
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,240
 up and down his own hands and slicing his own hands.

132
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,160
 So he looks down and he sees that his hands are sliced open and he notices there's blood

133
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,320
 and he's also realizing it's not just his blood.

134
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,880
 He's beginning to realize the horror that he just inflicted on this innocent family.

135
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,160
 He runs out of the house, tries to escape.

136
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,280
 Now Christine and little Kylie, they died at the scene, their wounds were so grievous

137
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,800
 that they just bled out in the home.

138
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,080
 However, Jacqueline and Joseph both survived.

139
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,840
 They both are doing totally fine and they're still alive.

140
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,800
 In case you're like, wait, this guy ran away, he's still loose.

141
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
 No.

142
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,480
 Keith has been arrested and that's how we know his side of the story.

143
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,200
 When the cops arrested him, he talks about that I was down in the basement, all of a

144
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,600
 sudden I felt this force enter my body.

145
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,800
 Something was controlling me from outside.

146
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,800
 It took me over and made me stab all these people.

147
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,240
 Now I don't think that's going to hold up in court unless I'm on the jury.

148
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,400
 Long time listeners of the show know that I have a fear.

149
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:54,080
 I think that's the scariest thing is people just snapping.

150
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,040
 If I'm in a house and someone's progressively getting crazier day by day, I'm not like,

151
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
 oh that's not scary.

152
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,800
 I'm still going to sleep with my lights on, I'm still going to lock the door and everything

153
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
 like that.

154
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,560
 I'm not going to be like, boring.

155
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,840
 It's still terrifying to live with someone who's progressively getting crazier.

156
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:17,200
 I think it is scarier if you're just sitting there playing Nintendo and then all of a sudden

157
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,480
 you're getting stabbed to death.

158
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,080
 Again, if you just think you're going to get stabbed to death over the next week, that's

159
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
 also scary.

160
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,920
 But when someone snaps, the thing about snapping that scary is that it can happen to anybody.

161
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,600
 You could be the guy who's chopping vegetables.

162
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,440
 You could be the guy driving the car who all of a sudden swirves off the road and starts

163
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
 running people over.

164
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,360
 Because you're just snapped.

165
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,720
 You're totally normal up until that moment.

166
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,320
 And when you add the element of not just having some sort of mental breakdown, but some sort

167
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:53,160
 of paranormal possession, like you're living your life completely normally and then you're

168
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,680
 at the mini golf course and you're hitting balls and stuff like that.

169
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,080
 You're like, this is the life.

170
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,960
 And then all of a sudden the next thing you know, you're standing on the corpses of a

171
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,280
 hundred children holding like a bloody club above your head as police are surrounding

172
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,720
 you and you have no recollection of anything that happened between those two things.

173
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,760
 That's ultimately, I think that's so terrifying, right?

174
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,280
 Because you would be telling the police, no, no, it wasn't me.

175
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,080
 It was the possessed hippo of hole 18.

176
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
 They're not going to believe you.

177
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,080
 Right?

178
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,520
 They might shut down the park.

179
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,200
 They might repair hole 18.

180
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,440
 But like if you just get possessed by something and you don't even know what's happening,

181
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
 that's scary.

182
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,440
 Like I've always thought like, what if you were driving down the road and the next thing

183
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,520
 you know, you're sitting in the holding cell of a jail and you're like freezing cold and

184
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
 you're like, what happened?

185
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,960
 And they're like, well, you went on this rampage and you stopped to place a mini golf

186
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,960
 and had another rampage and then you jumped in the lake and that's why you're so cold

187
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,120
 and you're like, you wouldn't know what was happening.

188
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,080
 So when I read this story, I was like, that's my worst fear.

189
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,760
 It's a lot of my worst fears, eating vegetables, living in basements and going nuts.

190
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,960
 And as I read this article, I go, what a great way.

191
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,760
 It's horrible that this family got massacred, right?

192
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,000
 I'm thinking, what a great way to start off the second half of season 19, right?

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,840
 The next 50 episodes, what a great way to get started.

194
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:17,600
 A man who loses it and slaughters a family or half a family to be technical, but we're

195
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,680
 not going to quibble with facts.

196
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,200
 He did attack everyone.

197
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:27,040
 But then I read this, this, this, this may take away a lot of my fears of being possessed.

198
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:35,640
 And finally, this guy had a history of, a history of threatening to attack people with

199
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,080
 knives.

200
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:42,640
 So whether or not he just snapped that day, he did have like a couple previous restraining

201
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:49,640
 orders against him from, or protective orders against him from previous girlfriends.

202
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:55,520
 And one of them said, yeah, he told me that he was going to come to my work and slice my

203
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,520
 neck and then stab everybody I worked with.

204
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,320
 So I don't necessarily know if this guy was possessed or if he just really thought about

205
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,280
 stabbing people or both, right?

206
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,960
 I think that like, if you wanted to stab people and a demon's looking around for, you know,

207
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,880
 some stabbing action, he would find you versus a guy who, versus the guy who just wants to

208
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,880
 drown strangers.

209
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,760
 And they also found marijuana and mushrooms in the home.

210
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,560
 They haven't said whether or not he was high at the time.

211
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,280
 But it does take away a little bit of the, oh no, officers, I didn't have any control

212
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,160
 when you have a history of threatening to stab people and you have hallucinogenic drugs

213
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
 in your house.

214
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,640
 But creepy nonetheless, right?

215
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
 It's possible.

216
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,640
 It's possible that a man who does a lot of drugs, who's talked multiple times about stabbing

217
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:47,440
 people could also be possessed by a demon and then stab people.

218
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,440
 Barking Bunny, let's go ahead and pick you up by the back of the neck and we're going

219
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,400
 to put you, yeah, as soon as you're just a Bunny Sides Bunny.

220
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,960
 Not like a giant Bunny like RV.

221
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,440
 We're going to pick you up by your neck and put you in the carbonar copter and rub your

222
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,480
 belly once more.

223
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,120
 We are leaving behind Stewartstown, Pennsylvania.

224
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,720
 We're flying all the way out to Houston, Texas.

225
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,160
 I remember last year when I took a vacation, I usually take a longer vacation during the

226
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
 summer.

227
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,640
 I schedule some time off of work.

228
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,520
 I go to California and hang out with my family.

229
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:26,520
 Last year my vacation had just started and the Wayfair conspiracy theory popped up.

230
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,360
 Remember that where apparently it was weird, right?

231
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
 It was super weird.

232
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
 I never really covered it on the show.

233
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,040
 I mentioned it once or twice because by the time I got back into town to start recording

234
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,160
 new episodes, people had kind of moved on.

235
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,640
 But the Wayfair conspiracy theory was basically you could buy, there'd be listings for pillows

236
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,480
 or cabinets for $10,000.

237
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,560
 You'd see the name of the storage unit, this big metal file cabinet, and it would be called

238
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,000
 like Model Josie and then $10,000.

239
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,680
 People started to connect the cabinets to the names of actual missing people.

240
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,560
 I picked the name Josie off the top of my head.

241
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,000
 Some of the names were kind of exotic and they didn't match up to people, children who

242
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 had gone missing.

243
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,520
 It was a weird connection.

244
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,640
 I never completely blew it off.

245
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,640
 I never did a deep dive into it because it was being covered by the mainstream media.

246
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,880
 I'm pretty sure Wayfair made a statement about it.

247
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,320
 I remember seeing it all over the place.

248
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
 I wasn't able to cover it.

249
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,600
 It was kind of done by the time I got back.

250
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,520
 If you don't remember, basically this website where you could order items wholesale was

251
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,440
 selling these and it was actually a cover for human trafficking.

252
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,920
 You would buy the cabinet and when the cabinet got shipped to you, you'd open it up and there'd

253
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,880
 be a kidnapped kid in it.

254
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,720
 So some sort of child trafficking thing, which I think would actually be quite surprising

255
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,160
 if you actually bought one of these cabinets.

256
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,920
 You're like, "I really need storage space and I have all this money."

257
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,400
 And then you open it up and a 10 year old girl jumps out of it.

258
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,840
 You'd be quite shocked.

259
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,200
 But yeah, that conspiracy theory happened last, I believe it was last summer.

260
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,720
 And then the same thing kind of happened this time while I was on vacation.

261
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,480
 A brand new conspiracy theory popped up and it's so similar yet different.

262
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,200
 And I have a conspiracy theory of why these even are taking the path they are.

263
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,560
 This whole thing is just so weird.

264
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,480
 So let's go ahead and start this off with once again on my quest to get my YouTube channel

265
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,400
 removed as we talk about these topics once again.

266
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,280
 And that's part of the conspiracy theory too as well.

267
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,000
 Just by talking about this, I could get the whole podcast shut down.

268
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,440
 But let's take a look at this.

269
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,760
 I do think it's, I do think it's worth risking my podcast to explore.

270
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,440
 On August 19th, 2022 is when this conspiracy theory first popped up.

271
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,640
 There was a poster on 4chan.

272
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,400
 There's anonymous poster on 4chan who notices something weird going on.

273
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,240
 I think specifically the board was politically incorrect, which is their politically incorrect

274
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,440
 board.

275
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:59,320
 But August 19th, 2022, this guy finds a suspicious series of listings in Houston, Texas.

276
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:07,200
 He finds a lot of aquariums that have a very simple naming structure.

277
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,600
 There's two letters and then aquariums.

278
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,400
 So you'd have HX aquariums, RC aquariums, AR aquariums.

279
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,520
 He found a bunch of these posted in a very, very small geographical area.

280
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,600
 And he basically just says, WTF did I find here?

281
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,640
 That's kind of his first post.

282
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,240
 He wants to know, does this mean anything?

283
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,800
 It actually, WTF did I stumble on was the actual name of the post.

284
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,760
 Oh, and I want to say this too.

285
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,280
 This was recommended to me by a listener, but they said they didn't want to be connected

286
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
 to this.

287
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,200
 I'm assuming they don't want their accounts shut down as well.

288
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,920
 But a listener did send this to me that said, please don't use my name.

289
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,880
 But I wanted to acknowledge that they did request this story.

290
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,560
 You had this, so thank you, thank you for that.

291
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,200
 You have this thing going on here and immediately the internet sleuths start to go to work.

292
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,600
 And the first thing you see with this is there's always a very common thing to jump to in conspiracy

293
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
 theories.

294
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:10,240
 They go, why would there be X as in when the Denver airport was built, the Denver International

295
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,840
 Airport, which has all these connections to conspiracy theories.

296
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:19,200
 There's this theory that it's actually a hideout, a bunker for the world's elite to live underneath

297
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,440
 the airport.

298
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:25,760
 And people who believe that conspiracy theory go, the airport cost a billion dollars to

299
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
 build.

300
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,720
 That's a lot of money for an airport.

301
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,120
 And then you have to ask the question, how much does an airport normally cost?

302
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,680
 And that's one of the things we look at when we look at this aquarium one.

303
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,560
 They go, why are there so many aquariums in such a small geographical area?

304
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,520
 Well, Houston, Texas has 2.3 million people in it.

305
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,960
 So the first question you would want to look at is how many aquariums do you normally find

306
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,360
 in a city of that size?

307
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,520
 Now, I never go to the aquarium, right?

308
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,920
 I find fish pretty boring, unless they're like attacking me.

309
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,280
 And it's the most exciting thing of my life.

310
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,560
 But you know, fish swimming around, they're pretty to look at, but I'm not going to pay

311
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,480
 money to go see them.

312
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,680
 So my question would be, 0 to 1 would be the amount of aquariums you would need in a major

313
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,680
 city.

314
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,720
 But you ask, is there a lot of aquariums in Houston as compared to other cities of the

315
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,960
 population base?

316
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,960
 The pushback against that, and this is a very fascinating conspiracy theory.

317
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,640
 I'm just going to be talking about whether or not aquariums are cool.

318
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,760
 Because people say you can actually mimic this in most cities in America, if not around

319
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760
 the world.

320
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:38,200
 You can look at your city, and there will be multiple aquariums with this two letter beginning.

321
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,200
 QR aquariums.

322
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,280
 HA aquariums, whatever it is.

323
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,720
 I'm making these, I'm picking these combinations out of my buttocks, but that's what this is

324
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
 going on.

325
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,360
 Now, when people are seeing this and people are starting to realize that there are a lot

326
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,320
 of aquariums like this, people start to really get into this conspiracy theory, but it always

327
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,400
 keeps coming back to Texas.

328
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,240
 When you read these threads, you'll start to see people go, "Oh, I see this somewhere

329
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
 else."

330
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,520
 But for whatever reason, the conspiracy theory keeps redirecting to Texas.

331
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,960
 These are basically the options of what this could be.

332
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,920
 One, it could be some sort of bizarre tax shelter or money laundering.

333
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,160
 That's theory one, right?

334
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,440
 That it's just a way to hide money.

335
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,800
 Theory two is that these are actual aquariums, but the reason why there seems to be a bunch

336
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
 of them in a...

337
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,240
 Apparently, a lot of times, these are found in shady places.

338
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,600
 You go to HR aquarium on Google Maps, and it'll show a wooden area.

339
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,480
 It'll show a place where you don't expect an aquarium to be.

340
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,880
 It'll show a house down the lane.

341
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,320
 So, people go, "It's possible that these aquariums are doing illegal things, but it's not like

342
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,480
 there's some sort of tax haven.

343
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,000
 They're actually selling illegal coral or illegal fish."

344
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,080
 So, that's why it's kind of off the beaten path.

345
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,760
 My question to that would be, "Well, then why are they on Google Maps?

346
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,640
 Why are you able to find this stuff?"

347
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,760
 Generally, people who engage in criminal activity don't put a pin on Google Earth and say, "This

348
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,480
 is where you can buy the best crack."

349
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,160
 So, if they're selling this, a lot of illegal businesses just go by word of mouth.

350
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,440
 But that's one of the conspiracy theories.

351
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,440
 So, we have that.

352
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,280
 These are actually just shell companies to launder money.

353
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,040
 The other one is that they're engaging in some sort of illegal business.

354
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:22,160
 And let me say, really, the first theory is that they're all legitimate aquariums.

355
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,960
 And some of them are just bad.

356
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,080
 Some of them are bad at being an aquarium.

357
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,280
 It's just a lake, or it's just a guy with a fishbowl sitting in his house.

358
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,840
 But so, we have these different conspiracy theories, but it only takes, it only takes

359
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:45,200
 about an hour from the very first post, WTF did I stumble upon, to, within one hour,

360
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,520
 child trafficking.

361
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,360
 These aquarium businesses, and there's a lot of them.

362
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,160
 Some of them are legit.

363
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,240
 Some of them are a trailer in a wooded area.

364
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,560
 But these suspicious amount, quote unquote, "suspicious amount of aquariums in this city,

365
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,720
 child trafficking."

366
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,680
 And it is so interesting to see how quickly this turns.

367
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:14,600
 And then it starts to become, "Aquariums means that the children are kept in giant glass

368
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
 boxes."

369
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,880
 Because we know historically that's the best way to keep a sentient species in one of the

370
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,720
 most breakable walls possible.

371
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,760
 That these children are kept in literal aquariums, right?

372
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,720
 They're trapped in aquariums and perverts will then come to the aquarium, not to see

373
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,080
 an orca, not to see a great white shark swimming around, but to see kids behind glass.

374
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:45,000
 And this is where I think the story behind the conspiracy theory becomes even weirder

375
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,040
 than the conspiracy theory itself.

376
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,240
 Because once that gets introduced, when people really start talking about this outside of

377
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,560
 these threads on the 4chan, they go straight to the child trafficking thing.

378
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,360
 They accept it as truth, and a lot of stuff has been accepted as truth in this conspiracy

379
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,360
 theory.

380
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,200
 This is a very, very new conspiracy theory.

381
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,460
 They already have these connections.

382
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,960
 They go, "Guys, when you go, you're going to be in a very, very new conspiracy theory.

383
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,680
 When you go to Google Earth and look at these aquariums, whether or not it is a storefront,

384
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:20,160
 whether or not it is at a strip mall, or whether or not it is a house, they seem to have a

385
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,760
 star on them."

386
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,320
 There's like a star painting, or a star poster, or a metal star.

387
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:33,540
 So stars, we know if you turn them upside down or satanic.

388
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:38,040
 We also got to remember though, we're in the Lone Star State, which is Texas.

389
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,200
 So unless the Cowboys are actually a big satanic group, unless all fans of the Dallas Cowboys

390
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,720
 are satanic, see, this is where it starts to get weird, doesn't it?

391
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
 They make this connection.

392
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,960
 I don't know if that's why they keep bringing it back to Texas, because they make the connection.

393
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,000
 They say that these businesses almost always, see, there's a big difference between always

394
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,640
 and almost always, has a star at or near the location.

395
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,640
 And even then we get all this will go room.

396
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,020
 Well, it's in the Lone Star State.

397
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,700
 But what I find so, and I could go on and on, there's a lot of other stuff, it's possibly

398
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:13,500
 linked to, there's a website in India called helpmecovid.com that some of these businesses

399
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,340
 appeared on and they thought maybe it was a way to take COVID relief money that was being

400
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,340
 issued.

401
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,580
 There's a whole lot of other conspiracy theories.

402
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:26,340
 Some people say these businesses exist in the maps, but they have no LLC paperwork.

403
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,380
 And to really verify that, you'd have to go through every single one and look up their

404
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,760
 LLC paperwork.

405
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,240
 They say that they never paid any taxes.

406
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,360
 And these are statements that people are making online, anonymously, and then you'll see it

407
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,200
 reported somewhere else as fact.

408
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,120
 When that website's not checking the LLC paperwork of all these businesses in Houston or in Austin

409
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,280
 or wherever else within or without Texas, we start to see all these other conspiracy

410
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,040
 theories pop up and so on and so on.

411
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,040
 But I wanted to take another look at this as a conspiracy theory as a whole to wrap

412
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,900
 this up because we could go into, I mean, I could read you off the LLC listings of all

413
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,100
 these businesses.

414
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,500
 We could do a sample and find out how many of them actually do have LLC set up.

415
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,940
 And again, I would ask the question is, this is truly illegal.

416
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,780
 Why would you be, oh, and that's another thing.

417
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,140
 Apparently people are also now faking businesses.

418
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,300
 People are in it because you can just put a pin of a business in Google Earth and say,

419
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,540
 claim this business.

420
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:27,100
 People are finding some remote area and putting a little pin there and saying QR aquariums,

421
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,560
 the best viewing in town just to freak people out.

422
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:34,840
 So the conspiracy theory has gone from a person innocently discovering this to these are

423
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:40,680
 the reasons why legit and illegal these may exist to pedophilia, cabal, right, straight

424
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,000
 to pizza gate.

425
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,440
 And that's why they call it aquarium gate.

426
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,800
 That's the first time I'm using that name in this episode of the title, but aquarium

427
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,400
 gate is the name for this conspiracy theory.

428
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,040
 All the way to now people are using it to troll other people.

429
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,920
 People are faking these listings.

430
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,580
 And apparently some of these pins that were a norm, first discovered are gone now.

431
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,380
 So there's this, it's become a very short period of time.

432
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,300
 I'm recording this on the 30th, August 30th.

433
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:15,060
 So just 11 days later, it's gone from mystery to pedophilia, cabal to troll.

434
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:19,740
 You know, now they're trolling each other by making up these fake listings.

435
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,780
 But let's take a step back from aquarium gate because at the end of the day, some of it

436
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,800
 could be totally legit, right?

437
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,000
 Some of it could be illegal.

438
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,280
 Some of it could be someone just is running an aquarium or they're out of, it's a home

439
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,960
 based business and they call it aquarium, but they are selling all these aquarium supplies.

440
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,000
 Some of it could actually be a tax shelter or a drug trafficking business, a front,

441
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,560
 a way to launder money or whatever.

442
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,520
 It could be even worse than that human trafficking.

443
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:56,140
 So let's step back from all of that for a second and take a look at why, I'm not gonna

444
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,420
 rant about this too long because I do have a theory, I developed a theory because of

445
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,420
 this.

446
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:05,460
 Why do these conspiracy theories always fall into the world of pedophilia?

447
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,540
 Like, I get it.

448
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,820
 That's like the grossest thing you could possibly be a part of.

449
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,760
 I said the other day, I would rather do 20 years in prison for murder than five years

450
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,500
 for anything associated with a child, even though you'd get out quicker.

451
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,320
 You're a scumbag, right?

452
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,180
 But you do 20 years, you come out, you've murdered a guy, people are always gonna ask

453
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,180
 "Hey man, what was it like?"

454
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,860
 You're like, "Dude, I was just chopping vegetables one day and the next thing I know, I was in

455
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,580
 prison."

456
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,900
 So worst thing you can be accused of, it's the worst thing you can be a part of.

457
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,860
 So but why does it always default to that?

458
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:46,700
 When we had the pizza gate scenario of the Clinton administration being tied into a pedophilia

459
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,440
 ring and stuff like that, because of the code on the napkins, people were saying "I want

460
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,280
 seven to nine slices of pizza at this party."

461
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,520
 And someone else goes, "I want 10 to 12 slices of pizza."

462
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,320
 You're like, "Who can eat that much pizza outside of me?

463
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,160
 I could eat a lot of pizza."

464
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,880
 And so it became this code for that's the age of kid they wanted at this party.

465
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,200
 That's where pizza gates started and then it evolved.

466
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
 That's what it was.

467
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,160
 And there was another letter saying, "Don't worry, we're gonna have entertainment at the

468
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,160
 party."

469
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,000
 We have three kids and they named the kids and they said six, nine and 12 or whatever

470
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 were their ages.

471
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,960
 People were like, "Why would you care what kids are coming to the party or what type of

472
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,960
 entertainment?"

473
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,220
 And even if they wore like a traveling talent act, why do you need to know their ages?

474
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:32,540
 Those two pieces of information is where it became Comet Pizza, Ping Pong Pizza in Washington,

475
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,900
 D.C. as a basement where they trafficked children.

476
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,180
 It came off of these hacked emails from Hillary Clinton.

477
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,900
 That was the origin of pizza gate.

478
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,140
 Now that, when you look at that stuff, I'm not saying that Hillary Clinton actually was

479
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:47,720
 trafficking kids, but when you look at those codes, those are weird codes.

480
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:53,360
 Who orders pizza and says, "I want nine to twelve slices."

481
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,400
 So that's where they go, "This code must mean this."

482
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,200
 But then when you got to the Wayfair scandal, when you got to the saying like, "Oh, someone's

483
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:06,000
 buying the shed, it must be a trafficked kid," you go, "Well, listen, there's a lot of reasons

484
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,480
 why you would pay $10,000 for a locker.

485
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,420
 The picture might look busted, but it's possible that this is an industrial locker that you

486
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,580
 do sell for $10,000.

487
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:21,220
 And if it is illegal, it could be anything from guns to drugs to human trafficking, i.e.

488
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:25,900
 smuggling people over the border, to pedophilia trafficking, sex trafficking, right?

489
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,980
 So why did the sex trafficking one hit so quickly?

490
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,980
 With this one, we actually can watch.

491
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,660
 These threads were archived right away.

492
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,100
 We can actually see how quickly it devolves.

493
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,780
 It took one hour to go from, "Wow.

494
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,120
 This might just be a coincidence.

495
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
 This might be a mystery.

496
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
 This could be drug smuggling.

497
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,680
 It could be tax havens too.

498
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
 It's pedophilia."

499
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,760
 And it's been that way ever since.

500
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,920
 That's just how this conspiracy theory is addressed.

501
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,840
 The star is Satanic.

502
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,520
 It's not because it's in Texas.

503
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,040
 The Satanic thing doesn't really fly with a tax haven.

504
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,840
 It doesn't really fly with a drug front, right?

505
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,720
 Satanic pedophilia symbol star.

506
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
 That stuff goes together.

507
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,920
 So it very, very quickly went to the pedophilia thing.

508
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
 And I get it.

509
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,580
 It's the worst thing to be connected to.

510
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,380
 But why is that happening?

511
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:18,780
 Now on the one hand, it could be because people tend to imagine the worst thing possible.

512
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:26,900
 But an hour into it, an hour into this conspiracy theory, we're already with that.

513
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:32,060
 There's been a lot of talk recently about how much of the internet is bots.

514
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:36,960
 And it's interesting because now a lot of websites are using the delay.

515
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,160
 So when you go to log on to a website, they're like, "We're going to verify that you're human."

516
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,760
 Big websites do this now.

517
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,000
 And every show often there's a little box that pops up.

518
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,720
 It's a little factoid about the internet.

519
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,400
 It says, "Friendly tip.

520
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,880
 There are a lot of friendly bots on the internet."

521
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
 I'm like, "Why?

522
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
 Why?

523
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,880
 I'm not going to hang out with these guys.

524
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,000
 Why do I need to know that there's friendly bots on the internet doing friendly stuff?"

525
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Just give me to the website.

526
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,640
 I don't need to learn something about the internet each time I try to log on to an

527
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
 website.

528
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,820
 It's just a catch-a-pause.

529
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,580
 It's to prevent DDoS attacks, the Nile Service attacks.

530
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,940
 But there's been popping up more and more often.

531
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,420
 There's been a lot of talk about bots, whether it's Elon Musk backing out of the Twitter

532
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,940
 deal because of bots, or the Twitter whistleblower saying they don't even know how many bots

533
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,940
 and they don't care.

534
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,260
 The people who are in charge of Twitter, they've never really seriously looked into that.

535
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,660
 Whether it's the empty internet theory on the conspiracy theory iceberg that a lot of

536
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,700
 the internet is bots.

537
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,980
 We think we're interacting with other people, but we're not.

538
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:36,840
 To this, I don't think it's a conspiracy theory that it's true that there is a concentrated

539
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,080
 effort to destroy the old internet, to straight up mud-flood the old internet.

540
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,680
 So when you go to look for news before, say, two or three years ago, it's a lot harder

541
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
 to.

542
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,920
 And I can attest that that's true because I've always been looking at older stuff.

543
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,360
 It has gotten harder to find those personalized web pages that are still up.

544
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,960
 If you want to learn about the history of Optimus Prime, you're going to be directed to Wikipedia

545
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,780
 pages and some newer websites versus the websites that were built back in 2000.

546
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:10,380
 Now, of course, some of those websites could be gone, but I do think there is an effort

547
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:15,660
 to mud-flood out to basically destroy the older internet, so it's easier to control,

548
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,660
 right?

549
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:21,980
 But that also would involve bots, because there would be no human who would be able to make

550
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,660
 all those decisions constantly.

551
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:29,700
 So you'd have bots crawling the web, deciding which pages stay and which pages are buried.

552
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:38,560
 And if you do have this huge army of bots, are they all individualized bots, or are there,

553
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:43,780
 like a mini science fiction, authors will say, and conspiracy theorists, is there an

554
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,340
 AI controlling all of this stuff?

555
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:52,020
 Maybe not one for the entire globe, but maybe a series of them based on the governments

556
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,820
 that they're operated out of, and maybe a few privately owned big programs as well.

557
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:03,660
 And when I'm saying AI, I'm not talking full-on Skynet, full-on Roku Basco-like type of AI

558
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:10,140
 at this point, but just programs that are doing the work of humans that humans can't

559
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,140
 do.

560
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,100
 There's just too much information going in and out.

561
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:17,900
 And we do have, we do know that bots are posting on Twitter, and they appear to be human.

562
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:22,620
 We do know that bots are posting on 4chan, and they appear to be human.

563
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:28,220
 People have complained, people have said, "I've seen posts that I've placed reappear

564
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,940
 on other boards."

565
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:35,580
 And it's word for word what I wrote.

566
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:41,460
 They wrote something three weeks later, they see it on another board, on another topic.

567
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,660
 But then again, as a troll people immediately begin taking that post that someone wrote,

568
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,020
 complaining that they've seen their posts in other places, and begin putting that post

569
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,020
 in other places.

570
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:54,380
 And not like copypasta either, he goes, "It wasn't some funny thing that I wrote.

571
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,820
 I just wrote an opinion about something, and I read my own opinion a week later on another

572
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,100
 board."

573
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,820
 So we know they exist on Twitter, we know they exist on 4chan, they most likely also

574
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,820
 all over Reddit as well.

575
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,100
 So all these main places, how many humans are you interacting with, how many are just

576
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,100
 bots?

577
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,980
 That's the idea behind the empty internet theory.

578
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:23,380
 And my conspiracy theory is that it is not the human need to look at the darkest aspects

579
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:29,100
 of humanity to say, "The worst thing I can possibly think of is a human trafficking ring

580
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,320
 that involves kidnapped children."

581
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,600
 That is the worst possible thing you can think of.

582
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,940
 And because we often dwell in the darkness, we're not dark people ourselves, but we do

583
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,780
 have a morbid sense of reality.

584
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,780
 That's everybody, everybody's like that.

585
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,740
 And someone gives you a mystery, a lot of times it will take it to the nth degree, that's

586
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,020
 just part of human nature.

587
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,740
 So that could be why this stuff always ends in pedophilia, right?

588
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,300
 It's this thing that gets your stomach in a knot.

589
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,500
 But what if it isn't that?

590
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,740
 It's been on our conspiracy caps and wrap up this episode, it ran a little long, but

591
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,460
 let's take a look at this here.

592
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:14,460
 What if it is the bots of the internet, the AI or AIs of the internet realizing that the

593
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:18,900
 number one way to get engagement, the number one way to get clicks, and we know this is

594
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,460
 a fact, is outrage clicks, right?

595
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:30,880
 And it is the bots, it is the bots that always accelerate towards the pedophilia.

596
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,620
 Not the theory itself, not the guy who posted it the first time, not the people who, I'm

597
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,660
 not saying everyone who's interacted with this is the bots.

598
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:42,460
 But what if it's the bots that are the ones who promote this theory above all others,

599
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:48,140
 not because it has some sort of sinister implications, but because they know people will click on

600
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,140
 it.

601
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:55,580
 They know people will try to investigate it because it makes you so sick that you can't

602
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,940
 look away.

603
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,820
 What if that's why conspiracy theories tend to go to that darkest point?

604
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,300
 Because when you look at those websites like Real Raw News and Dark Outpost, which are

605
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:12,220
 really, really hardcore conspiracy theory websites, they always go to that theory.

606
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,580
 And you go, Jason, the reason why they always go to that theory, because that is true, that

607
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:20,780
 is the theory, people in powerful positions, are pedophiles.

608
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,260
 That absolutely could be the case.

609
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,140
 I do believe, I believe there's pedophiles on all walks of life, right?

610
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,460
 And some of them are incredibly powerful people.

611
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:33,300
 But why did these conspiracy theories within an hour become pedophiles?

612
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,700
 It's pedophiles all the way down.

613
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,340
 I don't understand why that happens.

614
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,980
 And we have it happening three times.

615
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,140
 I think the code and the, again, it could have been drugs, it could have been anything.

616
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,780
 Again, I'm not trying to say that that's exactly what it was.

617
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,180
 But when I read those emails, I go, that is weird.

618
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:55,460
 That is a really weird way to phrase how many slices of pizza you want.

619
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,180
 But the Wayfarer one, I thought, and this is weird.

620
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,100
 I don't know if it's necessarily human trafficking.

621
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,100
 It could be legit.

622
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,100
 I've never bought a giant.

623
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,220
 So I've never bought a giant file cabinet.

624
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,300
 The pillows were weird.

625
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,420
 The pillows were $1,000 each.

626
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,380
 And even the mainstream media didn't even really bring up the pillows because they didn't

627
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,060
 have an answer for that, for the giant file cabinets.

628
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,180
 They go, well, these are industrial file cabinets.

629
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,820
 So there's just things in an industrial pillow.

630
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,220
 But anyways, there's always, and I don't have all the answers.

631
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,220
 I never claim to have all the answers.

632
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,300
 I just think it's so weird that it goes to that level.

633
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:30,300
 Now, what's interesting is whether or not there is a bot, whether or not there are

634
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:38,660
 AIs pushing us towards these darkest points of humanity to get more clicks, I don't have

635
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,580
 the answer for that either.

636
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:44,860
 Is it possible that the bots, when they look, when the AI overlords look at the internet

637
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,900
 as a whole, because we don't see it, right?

638
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,660
 We don't see the worst stuff out there.

639
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:57,580
 At the very most, you may go to a Reddit board or a 4chan board that has gore on it, right?

640
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,420
 Cartel beheadings or something like that.

641
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,260
 You go, ugh.

642
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,260
 That's enough for me today.

643
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:07,860
 Tomorrow I will be back to look at more horrible violence, but that's enough for me today.

644
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:13,500
 And to, most of us never even go, I don't go to none of that stuff, but most of us don't

645
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
 even go there.

646
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:19,460
 But there are people who go there and whatever, they're viewing that horrible imagery.

647
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,620
 And even they don't know how dark the internet gets.

648
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,540
 They hear whispers of it, right?

649
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,180
 You see it in news articles.

650
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:32,340
 There's a whole chunk of the internet and a whole huge portion of the dark web, the deep

651
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:38,860
 web, that has this horrific imagery on it, far beyond cartel beheadings.

652
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:42,140
 We're now in the area of stuff I don't even want to talk about.

653
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,820
 Now we're in the area of like snuff videos, all of this stuff out there.

654
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,820
 Now we don't see that.

655
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,740
 Most of humanity never sees that.

656
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,740
 You hear about it again in newspaper articles.

657
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:59,900
 But the AI sees all of it, and it sees all of it like a soulless god, right?

658
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:04,340
 And then you see it coming down at human suffering that's been caught on video.

659
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:08,380
 Immortalized in ones and zeros is digital file that's floating around.

660
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:14,980
 And while 99.99999% of humanity will never even know that file existed, the AI knows

661
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,980
 it.

662
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:25,860
 And it doesn't see it as any different than a video of a happy dog dancing to beat it.

663
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:31,060
 So if that is the AI that's creating these bots, it would weigh all these things equally.

664
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,860
 And it goes, well, I know that all of this horrible stuff exists.

665
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:39,620
 And it would look at it without the eyes of a human consciousness, a human soul, right?

666
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,060
 It doesn't see the depraved evil in that image.

667
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,140
 It sees it simply as an image, as a video.

668
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,700
 And it may be thinking, I'm just going to put it in this conspiracy theory because I

669
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,740
 know people are going to click on links that have these words in it.

670
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,060
 Social trafficking, sex trafficking, child sex trafficking.

671
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,860
 The bots are building in this conspiracy theory.

672
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:05,340
 It'll be interesting to find out exactly how much of the internet is human controlled

673
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,500
 or human, you know, it used to all be.

674
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,020
 There's not anymore.

675
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,660
 And it will be very interesting if we ever find out what that is.

676
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,100
 If we ever find out that 30% of Twitter is bots.

677
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,020
 It will change the game.

678
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,700
 30% of Fortran is bots.

679
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,700
 30% of Reddit.

680
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,700
 All these people that you thought you were interacting with were actually just bot accounts.

681
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,460
 AI driven accounts, for whatever reason.

682
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,340
 Either it's trying to promote an ideology or it's simply testing itself to someday promote

683
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,340
 an ideology.

684
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,060
 It'll be really interesting to see.

685
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,980
 Imagine if you found out that 130 of your friends didn't exist.

686
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,580
 What if you found out that one third of the people that you interacted with on a regular

687
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,060
 basis did not exist?

688
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,060
 So fascinating.

689
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,060
 It's such a fascinating thing.

690
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:49,500
 It's a conspiracy theory that in and of itself is weird and we can find a conspiracy theory

691
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,860
 in it as well.

692
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:58,380
 Are these theories being propagated by humans or by bots looking for clicks?

693
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,940
 How many of the conspiracy theories that you personally believe in or I personally believe

694
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,900
 in aren't real?

695
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,380
 We're coming across it a year after it was established and we're like, "Wow, that is

696
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,980
 really weird of those connections."

697
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,620
 But if we were there in the first week, we would see how things were whittled away and

698
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:18,100
 things, you know, edges were sanded off.

699
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,500
 And imagine then that there was an AI doing that thing.

700
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,660
 It wasn't a group of humans sitting around and trying to figure out what could be going

701
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,660
 on.

702
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:30,220
 It was a group of humans and three or four bots, people who don't exist, who are part

703
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,140
 of this conversation going on.

704
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,940
 This conspiracy theory is pretty quickly getting wiped off the internet and a lot of people

705
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,980
 attribute it to a cover-up.

706
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,580
 It's actually, and again, we're going to wrap it up like this.

707
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,420
 I know I said it two or three times, I wanted to address this.

708
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,900
 This isn't a super dramatic ending, but this is getting wiped off the internet because

709
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,140
 it includes a lot of doxing people.

710
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,900
 They're posting addresses, they're posting names of businesses.

711
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:00,860
 All of the initials that I used were just pulling them off the top of my head, but people are

712
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:05,980
 like, "This place is a child trafficking business and it was a picture of a house in a wooded

713
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,340
 area in Houston, Texas.

714
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,340
 That's not what I'm doing."

715
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,340
 It's possible.

716
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,340
 Listen, I'm always running.

717
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,220
 I think about it before I do episodes like this.

718
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:17,580
 The whole podcast could get taken down because I'm talking about this story, right?

719
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,420
 And YouTube has basically throttled me once again.

720
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:25,260
 I did really good there and got a bunch of subs for a while there, but they throttled

721
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,140
 me from time to time, but I have to make a choice.

722
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:31,900
 Am I going to do really cool topics like this that we can look into the world of conspiracy

723
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:38,900
 theory at the risk of getting shadow banned?

724
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,940
 Or do I not cover topics like this and know they are really cool and really intriguing

725
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:49,660
 and really neat to take apart and see and just talk about the same garbage that everyone

726
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,660
 else is talking about?

727
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,820
 I would rather take these risks.

728
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:57,540
 Listen, if the podcast got shut down, I'd be bummed, but this is just so fascinating

729
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,540
 to me.

730
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,060
 I hope you guys found it fascinating.

731
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,740
 I don't think anything's going to happen to the podcast, but you've got to take those

732
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,740
 risks, right?

733
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:07,540
 Otherwise, you just become the same show everyone else is putting out and I don't want that.

734
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,300
 And you don't want that.

735
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,340
 But maybe the AI wants that.

736
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,340
 Maybe they're like, "Nope.

737
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:15,180
 I'm going to put out the same show and at that point, you just kind of got to pack it

738
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,180
 up and leave."

739
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,540
 But we're not planning on doing that.

740
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:23,220
 Anytime soon, as long as the AI doesn't personally strangle me in my sleep.

741
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,980
 DeadRabberRadio@gmail.com is going to be your email address.

 You can also put this up at facebook.com/DeadRabberRadio.

743
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,420
 TikTok is @DeadRabberRadio.

744
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,820
 DeadRabberRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

745
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,020
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm so glad you listened to it today.

746
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,020
 Thanks for having patience during my vacation.

747
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,020
 See you guys tomorrow.

748
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,020
 Bye.

749
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,020
 Bye.

750
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,020
 Bye.

751
00:42:44,020 --> 00:43:10,020
 Bye.

752
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,600
 (upbeat music)
