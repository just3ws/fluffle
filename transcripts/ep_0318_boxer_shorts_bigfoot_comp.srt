1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 conspiracy theories surrounding the movie Joker continued to swirl.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:11,160
 A man goes on a very long walk for a very horrible prize.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,860
 And then we travel to Amish Country to explore a bizarre story,

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:24,660
 the time that three men had an encounter with the Bigfoot wearing boxer shorts today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:32,260
 [Music]

6
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,620
 Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:40,660
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,700
 I'm actually really, really sore, man. I pulled every muscle in my upper body.

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,260
 When I turn my neck, my forearm hurts.

10
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,460
 So let's hurry up and get this episode done so I can throw a heating pad on.

11
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,980
 I wonder if the heating pad can get picked up by the mic though.

12
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,540
 It doesn't actually make that noise, but everything makes the noise when you have a mic this sensitive.

13
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,740
 So Joker came out, what was it? It came out October 4th, so it was my birthday.

14
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,340
 So it came out about two weeks ago. I went, I saw it, my review was, it's good. It's good.

15
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,820
 Wasn't great. Wasn't terrible. It wasn't average either. It was good.

16
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,660
 And I left the theater and I've thought about the movie ever since. I think about the movie all the time.

17
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,380
 So right there, that's a recommendation. You should go see Joker if, this is what I said,

18
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,820
 if you're into comic book movies, if you're into really deep character studies, I don't think

19
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,620
 it's, you're gonna get your fill. That's kind of what I was thinking. It was going to be like a

20
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,980
 taxi driver. It was going to be like a Clockwork Orange type. You get to follow this character.

21
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,700
 Those characters I think are far more dynamic than the character of Arthur Fleck.

22
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,540
 But anyways, I did enjoy the movie. I found it very entertaining.

23
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:55,700
 Now, before the movie came out, there was a conspiracy theory that the FBI had gotten

24
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,820
 intelligence, a very credible threat that movie theaters in Texas were going to be shot up.

25
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:06,980
 It's big news. I even recovered it on my show. It didn't happen. And what was interesting is,

26
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,380
 as we were getting closer to the release date, I would see articles that would say,

27
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,220
 law enforcement says there are no credible threats. Law enforcement says they don't expect

28
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,780
 any violence, but they're being prepared and I thought, well, that's weird, because we just

29
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,540
 got that report from the FBI, you know, a week ago. So I started to think that must have been

30
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,420
 fake news. That must have not been true, that report. Then the movie comes out.

31
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,380
 And I'm clicking around. Every so often, I collide with the nerd sphere. I'm not really in that

32
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:39,380
 space as much anymore, but there are articles still pop up on my feed. And I see mass walkouts

33
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,020
 from Joker showings. People are walking out because of the violence in Joker and they're like

34
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,540
 showing these tweets and they're like, I got up and walked out of the Joker and I'm looking at it

35
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,260
 and I'm thinking, that's manufactured. That's not real. That's absolutely not real outrage.

36
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,100
 And you would look at the tweets and there'd be like 10 retreats, 20 retweets. Like that's

37
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,820
 manufactured outrage. I don't think those people probably even saw the Joker, but maybe they did

38
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,420
 see the Joker, maybe they did get out, but the media was trying to make it look like mass walkouts.

39
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,860
 People are leaving Joker because of violence. Doesn't do anything. The articles just disappear.

40
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,620
 Now we're in this weird phase where Joker's in another, and the movie's only been out for two

41
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,340
 weeks. So we've had the shooting controversy before it came out. Then we had the mass walkouts.

42
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,340
 That was the big news story after the movie. Now we're in this phase where I'm seeing article

43
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:33,220
 after article about Joker uses the song Rock and Roll Part Two during this icon. It truly is an

44
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:38,740
 iconic scene where he's dancing down the stairs. Like that is going to be parodied for the next

45
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,380
 20 years in cinema, maybe even longer. But he's dancing down the stairs. He's dancing on the

46
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:49,620
 stairs to Rock and Roll Part Two, a very famous celebratory song written by Gary Glitter, a convicted

47
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,940
 pedophile. So I'm seeing all these articles and they're like, how could he use a song? Are they

48
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,900
 going to replace the song on the DVD version? Joker embroiled in controversy. People are up in

49
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,260
 arms because they used the song. Well, first off, that song has been used in many media projects

50
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,180
 since Gary Glitter was convicted of pedophilia. So it's not like no one had been using it since

51
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,700
 1999, I think, is when he went to jail. And then the Joker just pulled it out of the bin. Like,

52
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,540
 it's been, it was used in The Office, it was used in The Simpsons. It's been used in tons of stuff.

53
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,860
 It used to be a big sports song. So when I'm looking at that, I go, this is not normal.

54
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:27,620
 This is not normal. Now, I've seen a lot of people go, oh, it's the SJWs. They don't like Joker. And

55
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:33,220
 I think that their target is wrong. I think that that sounded a little bit like the Joker wrong.

56
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:42,340
 Moray. The, I'm turning into the Joker as I do this segment. I don't think this is a push by

57
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:48,100
 a political group. I do think it's a push. I think it's manufactured outrage. I don't believe,

58
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,940
 I don't think the FBI issued that alert. And I actually said that in the earlier episode. I

59
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,580
 pointed the finger at somebody. I'm going to point my finger at him again. The mass walkouts, I think,

60
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,620
 fake, fake story, fake story. And then this one too, people are not really outraged. Maybe one

61
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,820
 or two people are upset that they're like, oh no, they're using the song from a convicted pedophile

62
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,260
 that's been used in dozens of media projects over the past 20 years. And it came to the point where

63
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:17,060
 the people who own the rights to the song had to come out and say, he doesn't get any royalties for

64
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,900
 this song. We're the rights holders and we get the money. He's in jail. He doesn't get any money.

65
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:26,820
 Like they've had to come out and say this because reporters are calling them up saying, hey, how do

66
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:33,940
 you feel about this song? Now, it's not mass populations of people. It's reporters. But it's

67
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,100
 also not, I don't think it's the political left. I don't think it's the SJW's alt left, whatever

68
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:44,900
 you want to call them. If it is, if my theory is correct and it is a manufactured push,

69
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:51,220
 I think it's Disney, dude. And it makes me feel bad because I love Disney. Like not like, I don't

70
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,380
 have a bunch of like Mickey Mouse stuff. I think Mickey Mouse is kind of lame. But I like, I like,

71
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:04,260
 I consume a lot of Disney media. But dude, this movie cost $50 million to make. As of last Sunday,

72
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:13,140
 it made $500 million worldwide. It is now the most profitable comic book movie of all time.

73
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:19,460
 It doubled its budget opening weekend. It made all of its money back plus a 100% profit, basically.

74
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:25,380
 It's first weekend. And the second weekend was gangbusters. It had very, very little drop. I

75
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:32,580
 think it's Disney, bro. I think that they realized that DC has always positioned itself to be, at

76
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:40,420
 least they tried. Zack Snyder tried very valiantly to do this, the adult alternative to the teenager

77
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,500
 Marvel movies. That's really what I think Zack Snyder was going for. And they got,

78
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,060
 he got ripped apart in the media. He got the, I mean, every review for Batman vs. Superman,

79
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,500
 which was a good movie. It had some issues, but it wasn't as bad as everyone said it was. I think

80
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,060
 it had a lot of cool stuff in it. And a lot of interesting questions about superheroes in the

81
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,620
 real world. Completely trashed. Justice League trashed, but that movie was a lot weaker. And I

82
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,140
 could see why people didn't like that movie. Batman vs. Superman, I was like, what? Really?

83
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:15,540
 People hate this movie? They, I think it's Disney. I think Disney hates competition so much that

84
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:22,740
 they are directing their ground forces to find something wrong with Joker. Because it's funny,

85
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,660
 because they couldn't really go after Wonder Woman without seeming like a bunch of misogynists.

86
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,300
 They really couldn't go after Aquaman without like, I don't know, okay, Aquaman's a fluke.

87
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,860
 Isn't a fluke a fish actually? So that's kind of a funny pun. If it is, if not, doesn't work. But

88
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:44,180
 I think that, oh wait, no, the, okay, now here's an interesting thing. Let me, let me stop here

89
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,620
 for a second. Because this is something we have to realize when we talk about this kind of stuff.

90
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:54,260
 I just made a whole point to say that Marvel has basically been knocking down DC movies,

91
00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:01,700
 creating controversy, and trying to get them in the track. That was the last 10 minutes of this

92
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:07,780
 podcast, right? And this is, I gotta leave this in because this is important. As I was going on that

93
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:15,140
 rant, I realized that at the very end there, and I had to stop dead on my tracks, that when you have

94
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:21,140
 a conspiracy theory, everything either locks into place or the conspiracy theory falls apart.

95
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:26,980
 Conspiracy theories are like Jenga puzzles. It's not even a thing. Conspiracy theories are like

96
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:33,380
 puzzles. Where if you have pieces missing, that isn't working, but conspiracy theories are like

97
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,380
 a building. If you have a floor missing, it completely falls apart. That's what I'm trying to say.

98
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,140
 And a lot of times conspiracy theories just leave stuff out. If my conspiracy theory was correct,

99
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:49,540
 then Aquaman would have been equally as trashed as Batman vs Superman, Justice League,

100
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,900
 and the way Joker is trying to be trashed in the media. But it wasn't. It was not at all. It had no

101
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:00,180
 bad press whatsoever. It made tons of money. I think it actually made more money than Wonder Woman.

102
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,900
 It was completely controversy free. It made a ton of money. People enjoyed it. The reviews were

103
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:10,020
 pretty good. So if my conspiracy theory is true, then Aquaman should have been like,

104
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,100
 "What? Humans can't breathe underwater? This is teaching kids to drown, and you would see all

105
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,420
 of this media attention and the critics would have hated it." But that didn't happen, did it?

106
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:26,020
 It did not happen at all. So I guess I'm wrong. I guess I'm wrong. Disney does not have a problem

107
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:32,740
 with DC movies making money. How's that for entertaining podcasts? When the host

108
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,900
 realizes it goes on a rant and realizes, "Wait a second. I don't have enough evidence to back up

109
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,980
 what I'm saying." You gotta be honest sometime. I do think it's... See? Look at now. This is me

110
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:49,540
 peddling backwards. I do think the Joker controversy is manufactured, though. I thought it was Disney.

111
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,180
 And maybe it is. Maybe, see? Look at how you can do the little words of it. Maybe it is. But

112
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,780
 it doesn't make sense in the context, because they didn't go after Shazam. They didn't go after

113
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:06,660
 Aquaman. And Aquaman was really, I think, DC's biggest hit at this point. So somebody's manufacturing

114
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,860
 controversy over Joker. And again, I don't think it's political. I don't know who it is, though.

115
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,620
 Because if it was political, I think they would have taken down Fight Club. I think they would

116
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:21,300
 have taken down these other movies. They would be working at banning a Clockwork Orange in libraries

117
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:27,780
 and stuff like that. That's why I don't think it's political. The plot thickens. Let's go ahead

118
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:34,900
 and move on to our next story. Our next story is a funny one because of the way it ends, but it's

119
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:40,100
 a little gruesome-- not gruesome, but a little gross as we're going there. It's October 1st,

120
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:46,660
 2019. So just, what, three weeks ago? Joker is about to come out in the theater,

121
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:53,380
 and Disney executives are in the dark going, "We must stop it. Stop it. Stop it." How do we do it? Do it?

122
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,580
 But the rest of the world-- in the real world, and that's not just in Jason's head,

123
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:05,460
 I do enjoy Disney Company stuff. We're going to Oshkosh, Wisconsin. That's a lovable little town.

124
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:11,220
 There, there is a man named Tommy Lee Jenkins. That's weird. Tommy Lee was the lead singer of

125
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:20,660
 that band. Tommy Lee-- was he? And then you had Tommy Lee Jones, but Stephen Jenkins was the lead

126
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:26,020
 singer of one of my favorite bands of all time, Third Eye Blind. Who was Tommy Lee a singer of?

127
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,940
 I know he was dating or married to-- who's that hot chick? Anna Nicole? No, not her. Pamela Anderson.

128
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:39,700
 I get all my blondes mixed up. Pamela Anderson. Tommy Lee was in like some like Butt Rock band,

129
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:46,820
 right? Like Van Halen or Sammy Hagar in the Hits or something like that. I don't remember.

130
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:52,580
 Anyways, Tommy Lee Jenkins-- this adult-- my point is that he has rock star names. Tommy Lee Jenkins.

131
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:58,420
 Tommy Lee Jenkins, 32-year-old man, lives in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and he has to move. He's like,

132
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,620
 "Ah, you know, it's time for a fresh start." He moves to Whitestown, Indiana. This is all on

133
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:12,980
 October 1st. He's sitting there and he's on his computer typing out his blog, and he meets this

134
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,460
 girl named Kylie online. That should be your first hint of where this story's going. He starts

135
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:22,260
 talking to her and he finds out that she lives in Nina, Wisconsin. What is it with Wisconsin?

136
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:28,020
 Everything's named like cute. Is there a Teddy Ruppskinville? You got Oshkosh, you got Nina.

137
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:38,020
 Now Nina is 14 miles away from Oshkosh, but now Tommy Lee lives 351 miles away from Nina.

138
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:45,460
 And to throw another number into the mix, Kylie is-- she's 14. She's a 14-year-old girl. It's

139
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:52,500
 October 1st. Tommy Lee Jenkins, 32, meets a 14-year-old girl online. Now he's talking to her,

140
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,700
 she's talking to him, he starts to send her sexually explicit photos, and he's writing gross

141
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:05,060
 stuff, and she's like, "Oh, oh, okay." And then he goes, "Why don't you come visit me? I'm only 351

142
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:10,260
 miles away. You should come visit me. I don't have a car. You come visit me." "No, I can't. I can't."

143
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:16,420
 Then I will come visit you. He doesn't have a car, and I don't know how the public transportation

144
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:24,420
 system is in Indiana to Wisconsin, but sometime after October 1st, I'm assuming at least the

145
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:35,940
 day or two, Tommy Lee Jenkins throws on a backpack, walks out the front door. He walks 351 miles to

146
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,740
 meet this girl, and the whole time he's texting her, he has to know that his luck was really,

147
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:47,220
 really bad because he just moved away. He used to just be, "What, 14 miles? If I-- if someone was

148
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,300
 pushing me with a cattle prod, I could walk 14 miles in a day. I think the most I've ever walked

149
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,500
 in a day was about 10 miles, and it sucked. I had to do it twice. I was at this girl's house,

150
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,780
 and she got super drunk, like violent drunk, and I didn't want to be there, and I bounced. I was

151
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:07,620
 like, "Whatever," and I walked 10 miles home. I-- as I was walking, the sun was coming up. It totally

152
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,620
 sucked. Anyways, that's an adorable version of the story of walking very far. He walked 351 miles,

153
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,460
 so he gets to her house on October 10th, and I'm thinking even if he left on the first and

154
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:25,780
 got there on the 10th, he's still walking 35 miles a day. It's like it follows. It's a monster

155
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,500
 getting closer and closer to this girl's house texting her the whole time. I could not walk 35

156
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,740
 miles in a day. If a zombie apocalypse happened and they were like, "The only way we can stay alive

157
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,140
 is to walk 35-- I'd be like, I'm dead. I'm just gonna stay here and let the zombies eat me. I-- there's no--

158
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:44,740
 I couldn't even fathom walking that far." But anyways, he doesn't. He's dedicated, and he walks,

159
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,220
 and he's walking down the street. He finally gets to a little nina. Everything's made of cotton

160
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,380
 candy. He's like, "Oh, this place is adorable." And he sees her house, and he walks up to her house.

161
00:14:53,380 --> 00:15:00,180
 He opens the door, and there's much cops in the house, and it was a sting the whole time. So...

162
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:10,820
 Could you-- could you imagine-- it's-- okay, here's the thing. It's bad enough. It's bad enough.

163
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,540
 When-- when-- dude, they totally deserve it. Like, they're creeping on these kids. I get it.

164
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,060
 When you get in your car and you're driving to this girl's house because you've been talking to

165
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,980
 her online, and you pull up out front, you walk into the door, and there's a cop there, or Chris

166
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,700
 Hansen, or whatever it is. You get arrested. You feel like a total idiot, and you've totally

167
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:35,940
 ruined your life, right? When you walk 351 miles over the course of days, it's raining, it's sunny,

168
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,780
 wolves are attacking you. I mean, that's a long walk. And then you get up to the front door,

169
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,500
 and you're like, "Yes, I'm finally gonna commit one of the most horrible felonies that I can possibly

170
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:52,180
 commit." And you open-- you open the door, and there's a bunch of cops in there. Minimum

171
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:58,340
 mandatory sentence for his crime. Ten years. Ten years, by the way. Some people do. I-- I--

172
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,700
 but anyway, it's a gross crime. I just think it's hilarious that they made him walk.

173
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:11,860
 Because really, the point of the matter-- the cops could have gotten him at any point, basically,

174
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,660
 for sending the explicit messages. They could have called the cops there, busted him. They could

175
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,740
 have caught him halfway, and if he's texting, "Hey, I'll be there in four days," as I'm walking,

176
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,900
 they could have used that in court, say, "Well, we stopped him halfway, because we thought that

177
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,780
 would be nice." But we knew he was on the way, and the judge would be like, "Yes, he left his house

178
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,180
 with the intent of going to this girl's house." Because they've done that, too, if you're driving

179
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,860
 to-- because I've watched a lot of that to catch a predator. They'll get people who are driving to

180
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,780
 the girl's house, but don't go into the house, but they'll catch the car going by. They still

181
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:47,540
 get charged with attempting to meet a minor, because they have all the photos and all the texts and

182
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:54,900
 stuff like that. They let this dude walk 351 miles, and you know those cops were laughing

183
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:00,260
 hella hard when that dude finally got to that door. You know that was the highlight of their career.

184
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:06,500
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story. Our next story here-- our last story would be a better

185
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:12,500
 way to put it. We're gonna travel, not walk. Let's hop on the Carbenter copter so we can fly over

186
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:18,980
 him. He's like, "Oh, my laser's so sore!" He has these ripped calves, but he can barely stand up as the

187
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,980
 cops just push him over. He falls down and they put the handcuffs on him. We're flying away in the

188
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:29,380
 Carbenter copter. We're going to Strasburg. That's not a cute place. We're like, "Bye, Nina."

189
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,820
 Strasburg. We're headed to Strasburg. That is in Pennsylvania. Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

190
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:45,700
 We'll leave the cotton candy landing pad of Nina. We're headed out to the Bleak wasteland,

191
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:50,980
 nothing but wheat fields and scarecrow. I wonder who-- here's two questions. Who invented the

192
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:57,540
 scarecrow? And like, how did they come across that? They saw one day a crow was in a bush and they

193
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:02,180
 ran out and they go, "Hey, crow, go away!" and the crow flies away and then they go, "Hmm, what if I was

194
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:08,900
 always out here?" And then they go, "Well, I have stuff to do." What if a statue of me was always

195
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,380
 out here and then they built a scarecrow? The reason why scarecrow-- do scarecrow's actually work?

196
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:19,700
 One, because whenever I watch a movie, there's a crow on a scarecrow. But two, birds land on statues.

197
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,100
 So why would someone build a statue and think, "Oh, that'll do it," and then walk away and a bird

198
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,260
 won't land on that statue? I think the first humanoid robots are going to be scarecrow's. They're just

199
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,260
 going to build robots to walk through wheat fields, going, "Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

200
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:34,580
 going to build robots to walk through wheat fields, going, "Ahh! Ahh!" and birds are never going to bug us again.

201
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:42,660
 So we're in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. We're in Strasburg. The year is 1973, three years before

202
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:49,380
 I was born. So imagine me as a little ghost spirit floating around in the ether during the rest of

203
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,420
 the story. There are these three Amish men just out there working. Of course, what story begins with

204
00:18:54,420 --> 00:19:00,340
 of three Amish people were doing nothing. Three Amish people were outside working and they have

205
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,460
 like a little house and then a little barn and then like their field and stuff like that, right?

206
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:10,340
 So they're out there. They're like moving sickles around. The cart full of sickles. They're like,

207
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,100
 "Oh no, the sickles are supposed to go by the wheat." They're like, "I gotcha," and they put it down.

208
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:21,060
 In any ways, they see a weird guy kind of walking through their field, which is a creepy way for

209
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:26,820
 any story to start. That's not the start. I guess it's the start. Anyways, creepy guys walking towards

210
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,420
 them. They go, "Hey, did you get one of those new Scarecrow's they've been talking about on the news?"

211
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,820
 They're like, "No, no, we don't watch the news. We're Amish." So anyways, they see this guy walking

212
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:40,660
 towards them. Now they're obviously a little suspicious of this thing because it's a weirdo.

213
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:47,380
 They don't know him. He's walking towards him and he's covered in hair. So they're like, "Oh, great.

214
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,500
 We've become a story on an episode of Dead Rabbit Radio." And the other guy's like,

215
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,940
 "What's a radio? We're Amish. We don't have those either." So classic Bigfoot, tall,

216
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:07,940
 hairy, but this one was wearing what was described as old style boxing shorts. Not like Mike Tyson

217
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,420
 shorts. There's insurance music. He's walking through the field. It's like, "All I do is win."

218
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:17,380
 He's like, "Everyone's like, "Where's that coming from? What's music? We're Amish. We don't know what

219
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:23,860
 that is either." Not boxing shorts. Boxer shorts. And I think it's interesting because all the witnesses

220
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:29,620
 to the story are Amish. And if they describe something as old style boxer shorts, they're

221
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,980
 thinking like 1400s. Like to me, it'd be like, "Oh, those look like boxer shorts from like the 70s."

222
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,900
 To them, they'd be like, "Yeah, the 1470s. There's stuff that's old anyways, but old style boxer

223
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:46,580
 shorts." Now we've covered Bigfoot to wear clothing before. I actually did a whole segment on it.

224
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,540
 What, 150 episodes back? The Bigfoot Who wore pants or something like that.

225
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:56,100
 And we've also come across stories where people have gotten turned into Bigfoot's

226
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,740
 or been mid-transformation into Bigfoot's. And that kind of always creeps me out because I hate it

227
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,380
 when people turn into stuff against their will. Like, you know, I'm going to do this real quick

228
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,020
 segue. When I was a kid, I saw this movie. It was a Doctor Who movie, which I'm not a big Doctor Who

229
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:15,140
 fan, but my dad was. And at the time, I don't think he watches it anymore, they had all of the

230
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:21,540
 time lords at the time show up to defeat this guy, this bad guy. And he was trying to get this gem

231
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:26,180
 that would make him immortal. And at the end, spoiler alert, for something that came out in '88,

232
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,580
 at the end of the game, the bad guy gets the gem and he turns into a statue that's sentient.

233
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:36,100
 Like, he's still alive, but he's trapped in a statue and that terrified me. And ever since then,

234
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:44,820
 I've never been, I have a fear of turning into things against my will. And honestly, I tried

235
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,620
 finding out what that movie was, like what the name of it was. I can't find no record of that

236
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:55,780
 movie ever even coming out. So if I got any time lords out there, any phone box junkies or whatever

237
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,900
 the hell you guys call yourself, you Doctor Who fans, you're Hoovians. Let me know if you know

238
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,940
 what that is. Where was it going with this? Oh yeah, Bigfoot. So we've talked about that before,

239
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:11,380
 and the idea of people like turning into Bigfoot's against their will terrifies me more than just

240
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:16,980
 Bigfoot. So this Bigfoot's walking around wearing shorts, boxer shorts. So they're freaking out,

241
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,980
 because it's a monster. It's a monster coming towards them. They're not like more calm because

242
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,860
 it happens to be wearing clothes. They're like, "Eh." And then to make things worse for them in,

243
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,260
 it sees them and starts chasing them. Now he's not like Usain Bolt. It's not like,

244
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:37,700
 but he's now moving towards them rapidly. Two guys, they split up. Two guys run into the house.

245
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:43,380
 One guy runs into this dairy barn. That's not-- the average people weren't doing that noise.

246
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:50,180
 The monster was. The Bigfoot. Now, there was a woman gardening around the corner, right?

247
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:56,180
 They totally don't warn her at all. But she hears this commotion. She hears like these dudes scatter.

248
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:02,740
 Monster man coming, and they don't go, "Hey Ethel, look out. There's a monster wearing shorts."

249
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,980
 They just leave her there. She comes around the corner, and she sees this creature,

250
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:14,420
 and it sees her, and it freezes in place. And then it just sits down on the grass, looks up at the sky.

251
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:23,780
 Clear blue sky, clouds, fluffy and white. The three Amishmen come out of their hiding spots,

252
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,300
 and they're looking at him. He's just sitting there silently looking up.

253
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,340
 So they approach this Bigfoot creature, and they try talking to him. "Hey,

254
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:39,620
 are you okay? Like, what's up, dude? What's going on?" And they notice as they get close to him,

255
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:45,620
 he's just distentious, overpowering. They said he smells like rotting flesh. People who work on

256
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,100
 farms-- like, if I ran into a guy who worked at Sears, and I was like, "Hey, what did he smell like?"

257
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:55,300
 And he's like, "A decomposing corpse." He'd be like, "How do you know what a decomposing corpse smells like?"

258
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,500
 People who work on farms, mortuaries, medical personnel, they'll-- they know exactly what it

259
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,900
 smells like. They come across it all the time. Not all the time. That's an unclean farm. But

260
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:11,060
 they'll come across decomposing pigs in their life probably more than once. So they'll know,

261
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,100
 they'll be like, "Yeah, it smelled like rotting flesh, is what it smelled like."

262
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,420
 Anyways, they're trying to talk to him, and the creature's looking up at the sky, and then just

263
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:29,300
 starts to... just kind of mumble. Like, it's trying to say something, but they can't understand what

264
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:35,460
 it's saying. And this goes on for a couple minutes. He's just... maybe like, "Are you like, can we get

265
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:44,420
 you anything? You need some milk?" And then eventually, Bigfoot creature gets up to his feet,

266
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:51,060
 and starts walking towards the dairy barn, and then he starts to fade away, and then disappears

267
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:56,660
 completely. A true mystery. So this story's been kind of passed around the internet on a couple

268
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:02,340
 different websites. Maybe true. Maybe 100% true. Could be false. Could be somewhere in between.

269
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,860
 There could have been some weird event that's kind of gotten constricted over the years.

270
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:12,340
 But it's creepy nonetheless. If it's not true, then it's a little less creepy, because it's not

271
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:19,220
 true. But the idea... this has all the things that I think I particularly find most petrifying

272
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:23,700
 about Bigfoot. One, they're in an area where you don't expect them to be. You're in the woods,

273
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,460
 you're expecting monsters to show up. This one was in the middle of a field. It has a Bigfoot

274
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,260
 wearing clothing, which makes... some people go, "Well, maybe the Bigfoot put the clothing on. Have

275
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:39,060
 you ever seen an orangutan with an army jacket on?" Like, if you want to believe that the Bigfoot

276
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:45,620
 are actually some sort of like, offshoot of humanity, or some sort of ape type cryptid,

277
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,780
 but then when they're wearing clothes, you can't just go, "Ah, maybe one day he wanted to put on

278
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:54,980
 pajamas." No! That's the thing. Like, that's where I butt heads with a lot of Bigfoot researchers.

279
00:25:54,980 --> 00:26:00,900
 A lot of them try to look at the physical reality of it. I think Bigfoot's are more, if anything,

280
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,780
 they're something else. They're not a separate species, they're something else. Is it a tulpa,

281
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:10,980
 maybe? It has something to do with aliens that's been made a connection a lot to, or

282
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,140
 something even creepier. It's people who have been turned into Bigfoot. So that's why we can't find

283
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,380
 them. That's why they're so rare. That's why they're relatively hard to catch, because they don't

284
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,140
 want to be caught, and they have the intelligence of a human. They're not a separate species with

285
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:28,740
 their own culture and beads and tribal stuff. I don't believe that. Because we come across stories

286
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:34,900
 like this, where you have a Bigfoot wearing boxer shorts, and the most bizarre part of it,

287
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:40,580
 he just disappears in front of them. It's not like he walked behind a tree and was never seen again.

288
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,700
 They're looking at him, and he slowly fades from view and then disappears completely.

289
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:52,980
 If a Bigfoot can disappear from view in front of three people, broad daylight, if that is simply

290
00:26:52,980 --> 00:27:00,260
 something that they can do, then the reverse must be true. They could appear out of nowhere.

291
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:07,940
 Fade in right behind you. Because despite the fact that this Bigfoot sat down and looked up at the

292
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:15,300
 sky like a poet, originally it was pursuing three men. What would have happened if he got a hold

293
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:24,660
 of one of them, and then faded away into nothingness? Would that man have faded away too? Would that man

294
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:36,820
 have reappeared someday, somewhere, as another Bigfoot lurking in the woods, and searching for his own victim?

295
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:45,220
