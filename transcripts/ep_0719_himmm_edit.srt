1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
 When a body with mysterious injuries appears on top of a pile of coal,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,920
 nobody knows what to make of the bizarre crime scene.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,920
 But one police officer believes that the murderer...

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,580
 was from outer space.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,080
 And then we take a look at the conspiracy theory.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,580
 Is Robert Downey Jr.

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,920
 Chaplain...

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,420
 Iron Man...

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,580
 and then, as he did something, he made more than those two movies.

10
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,680
 Robert Downey Jr. is he actually leading a secret crusade?

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,480
 To bring down Hollywood's pedophile elite.

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,480
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:43,160
 [Music]

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,160
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,160
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,160
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, so we're gonna slide right into this first stop.

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,660
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now...

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,140
 is our newest Patreon supporter, Diego Cubo.

20
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,140
 Everyone give a round of applause to good old Diego.

21
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,140
 Give him a little tickle, tickle his belly.

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,640
 Diego, we're gonna... he's like, "What? I didn't know this was something that happened now with Patreons.

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,640
 Just for you, Diego."

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,640
 Diego, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

25
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,640
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,640
 Just help spread the word about this show.

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,640
 Really, really helps out a lot.

28
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,640
 Diego, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jett.

29
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,640
 Behind Dead Rabbit Command, we're gonna fly through the friendly skies, headed out to marry old England.

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:38,640
 Diego's flying us around in the Jason Jett.

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,640
 I've had this weird thing recently where I wanted to learn how to fly a helicopter.

32
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,640
 I don't know where it came from.

33
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,640
 I'm assuming too many zombie movies, but I've been watching YouTube videos of like,

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,640
 how much would it cost to have a setup like a helicopter?

35
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,640
 How much would it cost to have a helicopter simulator setup?

36
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,640
 The price? $200,000. I think an actual helicopter is cheaper than that.

37
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,640
 They don't even have helicopters in Microsoft Flight Simulator.

38
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,640
 I want to get in the cockpit of a Whirlybird and just fly away.

39
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,640
 The rest of humanity is being devoured by zombies.

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,640
 I have this weird... not only do I have this... it just happened.

41
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,640
 It just started like a month or two ago.

42
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,640
 I thought, "Yeah, I really like to learn how to fly a helicopter.

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,640
 The man who can barely ride a bike."

44
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,640
 I think a helicopter would be easier, honestly, than riding a bike.

45
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,640
 Everyone's shaking their head right now.

46
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,640
 They're like, "Jason, please, please do not try to fly a helicopter."

47
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
 I think I do find.

48
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,640
 But anyways, until then, Diego is flying us around in the Jason Jett.

49
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,640
 He's taken us out to Tingley.

50
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
 That's in West Yorkshire, England.

51
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,640
 And I got this recommended to me by Hoots Cheech from the Patreon Discord.

52
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,640
 So thank you so much, Hoots. Really, really appreciate it.

53
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,640
 It's June 6th, 1980.

54
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:05,640
 It's 3.30pm and there's a local minor, job at not age, named Zygmund Adamanski.

55
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,640
 He's a 56-year-old dude and he's like, "Aye, Governor, I'm going to go out

56
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,640
 and I'm going to buy some stuff at the local store."

57
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,640
 We were like, "Okay, why do you have to announce that to us?"

58
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
 You are an adult, so you can go out.

59
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,640
 Zygmund leaves his house. He's like, "Can I cross the street, Maul?"

60
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,640
 They're like, "Yes, you're an adult. You can do what you want."

61
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,640
 Zygmund is walking down the street and then he doesn't come home.

62
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,640
 A couple of hours pass, he doesn't come home.

63
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,640
 And the family calls the cops. The cops begin investigating.

64
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,640
 They can't find Zygmund anywhere.

65
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,640
 Five days later and 20 miles away in the town of Todd Morden,

66
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,640
 Zygmund is found dead.

67
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,640
 And the way his body is positioned really sets off a whole string of questions.

68
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
 He's on a pile of coal.

69
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,640
 So first question, first question, is that doesn't look relaxing?

70
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,640
 Why is that dead man up there? Why didn't they let him die in a con?

71
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,640
 He's wearing a suit. He's wearing like pants.

72
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,640
 You go, "Jayson, I know what a suit is, but hold on."

73
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,640
 He's wearing pants and a jacket, but no shirt underneath the jacket.

74
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,640
 He's bare-chested underneath the jacket.

75
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,640
 His watch and his wallet are missing.

76
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,640
 So you go, "Oh, it must have been theft."

77
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,640
 Zygmund, well, someone walked down the street.

78
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,640
 He obviously had money if he was going to the store.

79
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,640
 His mom gave him his allowance that day.

80
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,640
 He's going to the store and someone clubs him over the head

81
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,640
 and drives him 20 miles away and then throws him on a pile of coal

82
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,640
 and then goes away. I forgot.

83
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,640
 I was supposed to rob this guy and took his watch as well.

84
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,640
 Robbery, right? The cause of death, heart attack.

85
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,640
 So you could go, "Well, you could have a heart attack being robbed. It's very scary."

86
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,640
 They could have went to go hit him with some brick-brack

87
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,640
 and he went on and had a heart attack and died as possible.

88
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,640
 But all that stuff is fairly normal.

89
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,640
 But then we get into the weirder side of the story.

90
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,640
 He had burns to the back of his head, his neck and his shoulders.

91
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
 So people are like, "Well, we've heard of heart attacks

92
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,640
 and we've heard of getting robbed."

93
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,640
 But generally, those don't cause you to have burns.

94
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,640
 Now, it says burns. We don't know if they're radiation burns

95
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,640
 and the skin's all bubbly. We don't know if they're like fire burns.

96
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,640
 We don't know if it's a sun burn. We don't know the extent of it.

97
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,640
 It just keeps using the word burns.

98
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,640
 But still, normally when you're being mugged, they're not like,

99
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,640
 "Okay, now let's walk around. It's a nice sunny day.

100
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,640
 Let's get a bunch of witnesses and take your shirt off, by the way."

101
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,640
 He also had this weird salve on his neck, some weird ointment.

102
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,640
 And you're like, "That's might be for his sunburn,

103
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,640
 or for his horrible, horrible radiation burns."

104
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,640
 You can go to Rite Aid and get some radiation away.

105
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,640
 No, they don't know what it was. They ran tests on it.

106
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,640
 They don't know what this ointment was on the back of his neck.

107
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,640
 And lastly, I have this in my notes, so I'm going to include it.

108
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,640
 I don't know if it's a clue or if it's just a weird thing.

109
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,640
 His clothes weren't good condition. He was wearing nice clothing.

110
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,640
 So his clothing wasn't burned. It was just on him.

111
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,640
 So you're looking at this crime scene, and you go, "Robbery, wallet, and watch this miss scene,

112
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,640
 but wait a second, you can have a heart attack during robberies.

113
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,640
 It happens. It happens quite a lot, actually."

114
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,640
 But who burned him? What is going on?

115
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,640
 Why is he in the middle of nowhere? How did he get 20 miles away?

116
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,640
 Where was he at for the past five days?

117
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,640
 And oddly enough, they noticed he was gone for five days,

118
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,640
 but he only had enough beard growth for one day.

119
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,640
 So the cops are looking at this whole scene, and of course the conspiracy theories start to pop up.

120
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,640
 You have some police saying that it's murder, some police saying that it might have been an accident.

121
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,640
 He might have just left his house and then was like hanging out at the coal pile and had a heart attack.

122
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,640
 Some people thought, though, more exotically.

123
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:59,640
 One of the theories was ball lightning coming through, and he's like, "Ahh!"

124
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,640
 And he sees the ball lightning, and then he gets electrocuted, "Ahh!"

125
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,640
 And then he kind of falls down on the coal pile.

126
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,640
 That doesn't explain how he got all the way out there.

127
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,640
 Again, maybe he just ran away. The ball lightning is chasing him the whole way.

128
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,640
 He's like, "Oh, I'm so tired of walking. I'm so taking time to shave."

129
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,640
 He's like, "Oh, I better shave. I better shave the ball lightning."

130
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
 He's all, "Ehh!"

131
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,640
 Knocking on the door of the hotel. He's like, "Ahh!"

132
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,640
 And he does this for five days, and then the last day he's like, "I'm not shaving."

133
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,640
 And then the ball lightning catches up to him.

134
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:35,640
 But, all of these are... The ball lightning is actually one of the main theories.

135
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,640
 I don't know how they explain the 20 mile five days away, but...

136
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,640
 Some people believe, and this is obvious, aliens.

137
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
 Aliens abducted this dude.

138
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,640
 Because we have issues of a guy disappearing.

139
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,640
 Appearing far away. Different time periods.

140
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:59,640
 Mysterious burns and an ointment that can't be described on Earth. It's RV Secret Sauce.

141
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:06,640
 And to make it even more of a mystery, one of the police officers investigating the death of Zygmund,

142
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,640
 was named Alan Godfrey.

143
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,640
 And five months later, he himself gets abducted.

144
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,640
 He sees a bright light. "Uhhh!"

145
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:24,640
 And the next thing he knows, he's in a room with two tiny people and a tall man with a beard standing over him.

146
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,640
 Then he realizes he had 25 minutes of missing time.

147
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:33,640
 His boot was split, and then he had a little red mark on his foot.

148
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
 So the idea was that it was an implant.

149
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,640
 And Alan Godfrey ended up writing a book called... It doesn't matter.

150
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,640
 It doesn't matter what the book is called. Don't read it. It's fake.

151
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,640
 I'm not saying that. He said that. Alan Godfrey, when he turned 70, came out and said,

152
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,640
 "Oh, I never got abducted by aliens."

153
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,640
 I made it up. He said it was a dream.

154
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,640
 He goes, "But I never got abducted by aliens. I never ever got abducted by aliens."

155
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,640
 So that's a real interesting wrinkle to that.

156
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,640
 He's admitted that it was a hoax, and he wrote this book about his story and the story of Travis Walton,

157
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,640
 which if you're... I haven't covered it on the podcast yet. Travis Walton, Fire in the Sky, they made that movie based on him.

158
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,640
 His story is unraveling. Travis Walton's story is unraveling quicker than a cat playing with a toilet paper roll.

159
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,640
 It's nuts. Like, I haven't covered it yet because I'm waiting to see how it ends,

160
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,640
 but a bunch of his witnesses are coming forward and said he totally made it up.

161
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,640
 I have a friend who met him, actually. She was doing a paper and she went and talked to him.

162
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,640
 She said he was quite the character, but his story is unraveling really quickly.

163
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,640
 Alan Godfrey admits that his story was fake. He wasn't abducted by aliens.

164
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,640
 And what makes this weird is that that's fa... It's not fine. You shouldn't commit fraud.

165
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,640
 But the Tenrab and Radio recommends not committing fraud.

166
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:57,640
 But the story of Zygman is a mystery. Like, people don't know what killed this guy.

167
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:03,640
 The mystery is still there, and then for the longest time, he was tied to the story of Alan Godfrey.

168
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,640
 They couldn't tell one without telling the other. And then it turns out that Alan Godfrey was lying.

169
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,640
 It's an interesting story because the Zygman case is real. It's a real mystery.

170
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,640
 We don't know what killed this guy. Maybe it was aliens. Maybe it was any other sort of phenomenon.

171
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:26,640
 And then someone created a hoax on top of that. And you can't research one really without researching the other.

172
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,640
 Because they're both so closely tied together. But one's a hoax. One's real.

173
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:40,640
 Putting on our conspiracy caps, is there a chance that the hoax was created to draw attention from the real story?

174
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:50,640
 I think stuff like that is more believable than predictive programming, where they have to hide stuff in the television shows to let us know what's coming down the pipe.

175
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,640
 That's so because there's... true life events happen on a daily basis. History's happening right now in Afghanistan.

176
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:03,640
 And I don't remember seeing the episode of Friends when the Taliban came into Central Perk and took over.

177
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,640
 It's like history happens so quickly. You can't predict a program. Everything. Everything. Everything. Everything.

178
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,640
 But I think it is much easier to go. This event's real. We want to draw attention from it.

179
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,640
 Let's get a guy who, for a little bit of fame and a little bit of money, he'll write this book.

180
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,640
 He will claim this crazy alien encounter and we obscure the truth.

181
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:31,640
 I think that's far more likely than predictive programming because you would need predictive programming for almost every single...

182
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,640
 History is made every single day. Major world events are happening every single day somewhere in the world.

183
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:43,640
 I wonder how predictive programming factors in Bollywood and Nollywood, which is Nigeria's film company,

184
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:52,640
 or all these other huge media groups around the world. I wonder how predictive programming factors any of that and the world isn't just Hollywood.

185
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,640
 But that's actually a great segue for our next story. Diego, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carvener Copter.

186
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,640
 I'm on a shell to something like, "Oh, I want to fly the Carvener Copter."

187
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:09,640
 I'm going to toss you the keys to the Carvener Copter. We are leaving behind England. We are headed out to Hollywood, California.

188
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,640
 [imitates caravan]

189
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,640
 But I don't know. It was during the vacation, I think, or it might have been right before the vacation.

190
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:32,640
 There's a Twitter user known as DreamPillot sent me a list, sent me a very sobering list of men and women who have been executed or are awaiting trial for heinous crimes against humanity.

191
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,640
 And I hope you will indulge me to read a few names off this list.

192
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,640
 This list I'm about to read you, at least a dozen good men died bringing this across the enemy lines.

193
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:48,640
 So let's have a little bit of respect. Put down that bottle of Gatorade. Put down that bottle of Gatorade and salute right now.

194
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,640
 Because this is a list of America's--no, the world's enemies.

195
00:12:53,640 --> 00:13:01,640
 These people that I'm--you may go, "Jason, this is all nonsense. What are you talking about? I want to drink my Gatorade. I'm super dehydrated."

196
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,640
 And what you're telling me is nonsense, but then I turn to you and I say, "No, it's not."

197
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:13,640
 This is a list of people who have committed some sort of unspecified crime against humanity.

198
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,640
 And therefore they deserve their judgment.

199
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:28,640
 Let's go ahead and take a look at this list. And I want you to be aware while we're reading this list, there are a lot of people who believe this is happening.

200
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:41,640
 This is from the same crowd, the Dark Outpost, Real Raw News, this weird version of reality where there's a shadow war going on right now between the good guys and the Satanic elite.

201
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:50,640
 And the good guys are winning, that's good if it wasn't completely made up. If the story wasn't completely made up, it'd be nice if the good guys were winning somehow.

202
00:13:50,640 --> 00:14:02,640
 But also I doubt 90% of the people on this list are actually "bad guys." I doubt there are people that you wouldn't even mind being stuck in an elevator with.

203
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:13,640
 But here we go. Let's take a look at this list. Adam Sandler was executed. Pink. You know, the singer, the singer of Pink?

204
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:27,640
 She's currently awaiting trial for some crime, probably releasing music. Angelina Jolie executed. Ashton Kutcher, world famous Ashton Kutcher, life in prison.

205
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:34,640
 Which is interesting because most of the people we're going to talk about are executed. I don't know how Ashton Kutcher just got life in prison.

206
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:46,640
 And you go, "Jason, I don't think I know why Adam Sandler was executed." Apparently this list came from the same type of groups that believe that we've talked about them a lot on Real Raw News.

207
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:52,640
 Recently Tom Hanks was taken to Gitmo and he was out, or some other base, I forgot the name of it, and they executed.

208
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,640
 And I left this out of the episode. I thought it was too grim. I thought it was too grim on my Tom Hanks episode.

209
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:06,640
 Tom Hanks last words. They're executing him for being in my ever-growing quest to get my YouTube channel demonetized.

210
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:13,640
 They're executing Tom Hanks for being part of the Satanic worldwide pedophile cabal.

211
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:20,640
 And his final words as they were getting ready to give him an injection. Not of Adrenal Chrome. They're not rewarding this man.

212
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:27,640
 A lethal injection. He said, "You cannot stop us. We are everywhere."

213
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:36,640
 Which I hope no matter, I hope Tom Hanks lives a long healthy life, but no matter what he dies of, I hope that those are his last words.

214
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:44,640
 I hope no matter how long he lives or what he dies of, his last words are, "You cannot stop us. We are everywhere."

215
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,640
 And everyone's like, "What is that reference to? What are you talking about, Tom?"

216
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:54,640
 These people, I'm assuming, also belong to some sort of Satanic cabal thing.

217
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,640
 Why Ashton Kutcher is just getting life in prison is interesting.

218
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:05,640
 And what's all--this list goes on and on. I'm not going to read all of them. I'm just going to read some of them.

219
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,640
 But we have names like Ben Affleck. He's unfortunately been executed. Great director.

220
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:16,640
 And then someone named Beatrix Wilheimer Armguard.

221
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,640
 Who's that? What movie has she been in? Some of these, I'm assuming she's some sort of head of state or something like that.

222
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:31,640
 But who is that? I mean, don't put her next to Ben Affleck, right? Because everyone's going to go, "Oh, Ben Affleck. I love the movie The Town. Oh."

223
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,640
 And then you're like, "Oh, who's Beatrix? Is this the woman who wrote those books about bunnies?"

224
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:49,640
 Britney Spears. Life in prison. Which is not any different than what she has now. But at least she has survived--actually, they're not going to kill her, right?

225
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:57,640
 Unlike my biggest crush. Like, obviously Britney Spears is my future wife. I used to have the biggest--I still do. I think she's still fairly attractive.

226
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:08,640
 Callista Flockhart. Remember her? You're like, "No, Jason, I don't remember her." Callista Flockhart. I had the biggest crush on her. She's been executed for unspecified crimes.

227
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:16,640
 Probably not. Probably not picking up the phone when this stalker who created this list called her. Helen Hunt, another childhood crush of mine.

228
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:27,640
 Executed. Howie Mandel. If you're a huge fan of Howie Mandel, be assured that he's awaiting trial. He hasn't been executed yet. There still is a chance to break him out.

229
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:39,640
 Also, Selena Gomez is awaiting trial. So that would kind of be like a cool road trip movie right now. Howie Mandel and Selena Gomez have to break out of Guantanamo Bay for crimes against humanity.

230
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:46,640
 They go on a road trip. They just drive around Cuba and then get caught. And they are both executed because that's what these people want.

231
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:59,640
 All of the friends, all of the cast of friends, have been executed at this point. Close personal friend of the show, Miley Cyrus. People get pissed off whenever I bring up this story, but Miley Cyrus.

232
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:11,640
 Rest in peace. She has been, unfortunately, executed at this point as well as Priff Wine Dog Symeru.

233
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:18,640
 Prime Minister of Wales. Who cares? Miley Cyrus is dead. I don't care about Priff.

234
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:29,640
 Robert Downey Jr. Executed. Seth Green. Sean Carter. And someone known as, again, if you're standing next to, you got three people in line.

235
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:39,640
 You got Seth Green. You got Sean Carter, who's Jay-Z. And then you got Sylvia Renat Summerlath Gustaf, who's the Queen of Sweden.

236
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:52,640
 Who cares about that person? You got Sean Carter, Jay-Z. He's dope. Seth Green. He was on Buffy. I'm not the biggest Seth Green fan, but whatever.

237
00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:00,640
 I don't want to see the man executed. I don't want to see the guy killed. Who in the world is Sylvia Renat Summerlath Gustaf?

238
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,640
 I mean, I know she's the Queen of Sweden, but I could bump into her on an elevator. If she wasn't wearing a giant royal gown, I wouldn't know who she was.

239
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:16,640
 You're like, Jay-Z, this isn't a list of people you know. This isn't just a list of famous people. These are people who are being killed for crimes against humanity.

240
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:34,640
 Why are you laughing? This is a serious subject, dude. These people have all committed unspecified crimes that have somehow landed Ashton Kutcher and Britney Spears' life in prison, but Tom Cruise executed one of the best science fiction actors out there.

241
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:54,640
 And Taylor Swift is currently under house arrest, so you still have a chance to stalkers of the world unite? You know where she's at? She's currently being held by unspecified group of freedom fighters, I'm guessing, who are going to hold her in account for not putting out an album as good as 1989.

242
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:06,640
 Who knows? But anyway, so that is a list, and Vin Diesel's executed as well, but whatever I'm more concerned about, Prith and Sylvia, than Vin Diesel, because I don't believe anyone could kill Vin Diesel.

243
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:22,640
 He'll come back. This is this interesting list that Dreampillot sent me, and I've parsed it down. There's probably at least 150 names on there. I picked the ones that were important to me, the ones that I knew, and a couple of ones I didn't to prove a point.

244
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:36,640
 But I was reading this list and I was shedding a tear from a good friend, Miley Cyrus, and I was drawing up plans to break Britney Spears out of prison, and then I was going through the list and I said, "Roberd Downey Jr., well now I know this is fake. I know this is fake now."

245
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,640
 Everyone else could have been killed or awaiting trial, but Robert Downey Jr., he would never be one of the bad guys. Ever.

246
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:52,640
 This is a really interesting story. I've wanted to cover this one for a long time. I have a feeling I may have mentioned it on a past episode, but I've never done a full breakdown on it.

247
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:01,640
 Robert Downey Jr., part of the pedophile cabal that runs Hollywood. False! Absolutely false!

248
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:13,640
 In fact, there have been long running rumors that Robert Downey Jr. is waging a war against the pedophiles in Hollywood.

249
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:23,640
 Back in 2012, which is kind of the height of this, on these websites called "Blind Items," they're telling me I'm a huge fan of longtime listeners of the show, and I know I'm a huge fan of celebrity gossip.

250
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:30,640
 It's a sickness. I read all about this celebrity gossip. I never talk about it on the show, but I love reading about celebrity gossip.

251
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:38,640
 So a lot of times, and when you mix celebrity gossip with conspiracy theory, that's really when it takes off for me.

252
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:46,640
 So there are websites like Alt Celebrity Gossip or ACG. I'll put it on the show notes, and there's another one called Crazy Days and Nights.

253
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:56,640
 So celebrity gossip has these things called "Blind Items," and what they are is some gossip with no name attached to it.

254
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,640
 And people have to figure out the name, and basically the best guest celebrity of who could be is added to the blind item.

255
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,640
 So you get a little bit of gossip, you get a little bit of puzzle, and a lot of times you get the answer to the puzzle.

256
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,640
 So let me read one of these to you how this goes. This is a blind item just from August 2nd.

257
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:23,640
 This recent A-list singer is just numb at this point. She's going through the motions and doing what she is told to do, that you can tell she hates every second of it.

258
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,640
 She loves the money and the fame, though. She needs professional help, but won't get it.

259
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,640
 So you read that, and it's like someone from close to her inner circle saying, "They don't want to come out and say the person's name?"

260
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:42,640
 Because then it's not liable if you don't say the person's name, or maybe they don't want to be traced back to them or whatever, and then people kind of figure out who it is.

261
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,640
 That one is supposedly about Billie Eilish. It makes sense. A-list singer, da-da-da-da.

262
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,640
 And then we have a lot of these, though, are tied into crime, and a lot of them are tied into sex crimes.

263
00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:03,640
 Because when I talk about the pedophile elite ruling Hollywood, we're talking about this idea of the Illuminati eating babies and all this stuff, kind of this farciful version of this group.

264
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:09,640
 There really are pedophiles in Hollywood. Like when I'm like, "Oh, trying to take down the pedophiles in Hollywood,"

265
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:18,640
 and when we're talking about this umbrella group that supposedly you can't even book an ad for a Maybelline unless you take a bite of a baby's toe, that's not true.

266
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,640
 But there actually are casting agents and directors and producers and stuff like that that are pedophiles. Make up a hundred percent.

267
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:30,640
 There are pedophile bankers. There are pedophile people who work at the steel mill. There are just pedophiles everywhere, unfortunately.

268
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:38,640
 But so when I talk about that, that's what I mean. I'm talking about this ridiculous conspiracy theory that every single facet of Hollywood, all of it, is controlled by the pedophile.

269
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:47,640
 But a lot of these blind items, because it is a very enclosed industry, do involve sex crimes. Here's a blind item that just popped up the other day.

270
00:23:47,640 --> 00:24:01,640
 This A-list dual threat actor who is in a new superhero movie and does the streaming thing on a hit show, knows this foreign born underage actress has been groomed her whole life

271
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:10,640
 and wants everyone to know he has tried to stop it, but he is not her actual parent and doesn't have that much he can do.

272
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,640
 And so people are looking at this, they're like, "A-list dual threat actor, superhero movie, da-da-da." They have deciphered this.

273
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,640
 Now I'm not saying these blind items are true, even the Billy Eilish one. But this is what this blind item is saying.

274
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:31,640
 The actor is David Harbour from Stranger Things, and the young woman he's trying to help out is Millie Bobby Brown, who is his co-star on Stranger Things.

275
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:39,640
 And you read stuff like that and you go, "If this is true," and I'm not saying it is true, but if this is true, what a good guy, right?

276
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:50,640
 What a good guy. He's just sitting there, he goes in, he gets a job on Stranger Things. Again, conspiracy cap fully, I'm not saying it's true, but he goes in, he gets a job, he's just doing his thing, and he sees something horrible happening in the background.

277
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,640
 He's trying to help, he's trying to help, he's trying to help, but at the end of the day, he only has so much power.

278
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:08,640
 So that's a great, I'm not saying that's true, but that's a great segue, and if that is true, he's a good guy, and there are a lot of good people out there who do, you don't have to work at a movie set to do the right thing and to try to help people out.

279
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:21,640
 That's a good segue into the story of him, H-I-M-M-M, him was this codename used by someone who was constantly calling out Hollywood pedophiles, and it could be anyone in the industry.

280
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,640
 You'd be high level producers, it could just be people walking down the street, you're like, "Hey, look, that's a pedophile."

281
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,640
 He was constantly calling these people out on the blind items, and he basically developed a bit of a cult.

282
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:42,640
 I remember when you were reading the blind items and you saw one from him, you knew this guy was going to be dropping some truth bombs about what's going on in Hollywood.

283
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,640
 And I gotta say, stop this too.

284
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:57,640
 Robert Downey Jr.'s publicist, because this really became huge back in 2012, and it actually got big again during the whole Wayfair scandal, and this meme came out that Robert Downey Jr. is him.

285
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:05,640
 Robert Downey Jr. is the person posting under the pseudonym of him, and he's calling out pedophiles left and right, saying, "Listen, don't work with this guy, this guy's super gross."

286
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,640
 And again, he would write it as a blind item, wouldn't give a name, but people could easily guess the name.

287
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:17,640
 His publicist, Robert Downey Jr.'s publicist came forward and said, "He is not him. This is not Robert Downey Jr.'s doing."

288
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:23,640
 And we're looking at legal options to take down websites that say that Robert Downey Jr. is him.

289
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,640
 And so I'm not saying Robert Downey Jr. is him. We are simply looking at the story.

290
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:36,640
 So here's the thing, you're like, "Jason, why would a publicist come forward and say, 'My client is not fighting pedophilia.'"

291
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,640
 Well, I can't really think of a good reason why. I can't really think of a good reason.

292
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,640
 But anyways, the publicist said it's not Robert Downey Jr. quit spreading these lies.

293
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:55,640
 But Robert Downey Jr. was the conspiracy theory. Robert Downey Jr. was him. Was the guy who was putting this stuff out there.

294
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,640
 Why do you think it's Robert Downey Jr.? People are like, "That's such a weird thing to connect to."

295
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:06,640
 Well, Robert Downey Jr. had been in the industry a long time, and what we know of him, they said that they got addicted to drugs.

296
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,640
 They almost completely nuked their career, but got sober and got everything back together.

297
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,640
 That's Robert Downey Jr.'s story.

298
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,640
 Also, sometimes there would be blind items that other people would submit about Robert Downey Jr.

299
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,640
 They'd say, "Robert Downey Jr. secretly loves to cross-dress."

300
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,640
 And then some time would pass, and him would post a blind item about something, something else,

301
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,640
 and then in the middle of it, it would say, "I don't like to cross-dress, but I do look good in pumps."

302
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,640
 And people go, "Why did he add that in there?"

303
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,640
 And people go, "Oh, because he was saying that other blind item earlier wasn't true."

304
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,640
 And then I remember when this list came out, I thought it was really interesting.

305
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:52,640
 The him account said, "Listen, everyone talks about all the bad people in Hollywood, because those are the easiest ones to remember."

306
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,640
 He goes, "Think about all the creepy teachers that you had in school. You remember them right away.

307
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,640
 Now try to remember all the good teachers. There's just too many of them.

308
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:09,640
 Like, you do have one or two creepy teachers, hopefully not more, but when you think of all the good to great teachers, they just, you can't list them all."

309
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,640
 So he goes, "I'm going to take some time, and I'm going to list all the good people in Hollywood, all the good guys.

310
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,640
 We're going to list right here."

311
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,640
 And almost every name on this list could be tied to Robert Downey Jr. in one way or the other.

312
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,640
 I remember reading this list online, and I thought, "Well, that's interesting."

313
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,640
 Because we saw that connection right there.

314
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,640
 So I wanted to share some of these names for you.

315
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,640
 You're like, "Are you going to read a list of names again?"

316
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:39,640
 Yes, but these are the names of good people in Hollywood, according to him.

317
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,640
 Really, really interesting, because some of you guys may go, "Oh, I like that guy."

318
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,640
 Or some more curious, some of you people may go, "I hate that person, but he's a good guy."

319
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,640
 And you could go, "Jay, this is just a list on the internet. There's a whole to no weight whatsoever."

320
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:59,640
 If we accept, let's put it on a conspiracy conspiracy, because the him account, whoever it was, I don't believe they're selective.

321
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,640
 I haven't found them lately, was calling out pedophilia in Hollywood.

322
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:10,640
 And again, not like this super secret elite group that was devouring babies and frazzled drip videos and all that stuff.

323
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,640
 These are just people that you have a chance of working within the industry.

324
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640
 Stay away from these people.

325
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,640
 Putting their job on the line, their career on the line by calling these people out in very real terms.

326
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,640
 Again, this wasn't this Illuminati level conspiracy theory.

327
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,640
 This was like, "This makeup artist, you may come across as makeup artist if you're a young person, or you have a kid that's in the industry. Stay away from them."

328
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,640
 So he was really calling them out.

329
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,640
 Allegations, just allegations.

330
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,640
 So it may have some weight when he says he's a good people.

331
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,640
 And he goes, "None of these people are perfect."

332
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:50,640
 He basically says, "None of these people are perfect. A lot of them have warts and flaws, but they're a lot better than the sickos out there."

333
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
 Way better. These are great people.

334
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,640
 John Hughes, famous 80s director John Hughes.

335
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,640
 Neil Patrick Harris.

336
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
 John Hamm.

337
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,640
 Guy Ritchie.

338
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,640
 Tommy Lee Jones.

339
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,640
 These are all stand-up people in Hollywood.

340
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
 Everyone that him had come across.

341
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,640
 And possibly even people who helped him fight this war against pedophiles.

342
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,640
 Maddie Nippard, I don't know if that's true, but it sounds good.

343
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,640
 Drew Barrymore.

344
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640
 Right? She's dope.

345
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,640
 Steve Martin.

346
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,640
 But Jason, you're just reading the list.

347
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
 Hold on, it's a good list.

348
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
 Rachel McAdams.

349
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,640
 Brad Pitt.

350
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
 He seems like a dope dude, right?

351
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,640
 You would see that guy like beating up pedophiles.

352
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,640
 Carving a pedophile symbol into someone's head.

353
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,640
 John Favreau.

354
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,640
 This was where I was like, "Hmm, people are going to be very conflicted by this."

355
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,640
 I thought, "Half of my listeners are going to be conflicted by this name, who's listed as one of the good people in Hollywood."

356
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,640
 Not just good, one of the great people in Hollywood.

357
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,640
 Great human being working in this industry.

358
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,640
 Amber Heard.

359
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,640
 And then I thought, "Oh, this name's going to confuse the other half of my audience."

360
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
 Johnny Depp.

361
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,640
 Both of those are people that, the Hymn account says they're actually really, really good people.

362
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,640
 Not perfect, but they're good people.

363
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,640
 And they currently have a lot of stuff going on between the two of them and their divorce.

364
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,640
 Jerry Bruckheimer.

365
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,640
 So I do think that pretty much does split the audience 50/50, what side you take.

366
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,640
 Probably 30/30, and the other 30% goes, "I don't know who either of those people are, and if I did, I wouldn't care."

367
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,640
 Jerry Bruckheimer.

368
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,640
 Molly Ringwald, again, very close associate to Robert Downey Jr.

369
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,640
 Tom Hanks is on this list.

370
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,640
 Tom Hanks.

371
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,640
 So who do you trust?

372
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,640
 Him.

373
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,640
 You trust this anonymous source on the Internet?

374
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,640
 Or that other anonymous source on the Internet?

375
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
 Come on, guys.

376
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,640
 Miranda Cosgrove.

377
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
 I. Carly.

378
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,640
 Out of all of these people, I mean, what great company.

379
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,640
 You're with Guy Ritchie and Steve Martin and Tom Hanks and Miranda Cosgrove.

380
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,640
 And Robert Downey Jr.

381
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,640
 Co-present an award, like the Teen Choice Awards with Miranda Cosgrove.

382
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,640
 So it wouldn't make sense they had met each other.

383
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,640
 Seth MacFarland.

384
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,640
 And this list is old.

385
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,640
 This is before he was calling out like Kevin Spacey on Family Guy, and he was calling out Harvey Weinstein and stuff like that.

386
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,640
 So that's another thing that legitimized this list for me.

387
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,640
 Was that this list was way before that.

388
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,640
 Seth MacFarland stood up on stage and called Harvey Weinstein a sexual predator.

389
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,640
 In not so many words.

390
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,640
 He had to make it a joke.

391
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,640
 But he was calling these people out too.

392
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,640
 Elton John and Kate Beckinsale round out the list.

393
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,640
 Actually, no, they don't round out the list.

394
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:31,640
 The last name he gives, and this is the one where he's like, "Even this dude. Even this dude."

395
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,640
 And he's a close personal friend of Robert Downey Jr.

396
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,640
 And they have both helped each other out at their lowest moments.

397
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,640
 Mel Gibson.

398
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,640
 Mel Gibson for all of his faults.

399
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,640
 For his alcoholism and his anti-Semitism.

400
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,640
 Him saying at his core, "He's a good person. He's a good person at his core."

401
00:32:52,640 --> 00:33:00,640
 Very, very interesting list of people who may actually be fighting the good fight.

402
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,640
 Not against the Illuminati, but against the ind-- and again, I'm adding this.

403
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,640
 He did not say that they're fighting this fight, but I want to imagine.

404
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:13,640
 And I do believe there are good people in Hollywood, including people like David Harbour, if that blind item is true.

405
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,640
 There are good people in Hollywood fighting this.

406
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:21,640
 It's not this monolithic, satanic, Illuminati, pedophile cult.

407
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,640
 But there are people in Hollywood who are sick.

408
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,640
 And there are people in every single industry who are sick.

409
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,640
 There are probably people at your workplace who are sick.

410
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,640
 And I'm not saying sick like they need to get help.

411
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,640
 I'm saying sick like they're perverts.

412
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,640
 And they want to hurt children.

413
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:45,640
 And it's up to the good people to not work with them, to if they can expose them.

414
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,640
 Because sometimes that's obviously like what we want to do in the movies.

415
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,640
 You stand up on your desk and you go, "You're a pedophile."

416
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,640
 And you're a pedophile. You, you're not a pedophile, but you.

417
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
 You are the biggest pedophile of all.

418
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,640
 And people are like, "What?"

419
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,640
 Don't do that. Don't do that unless you have evidence.

420
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,640
 But you know what I mean? Like you want to take these people down.

421
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,640
 You want to expose them. And you want to make the world a better place.

422
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,640
 You really want to make your workplace a better place.

423
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,640
 You want to make the industry a better place.

424
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,640
 And in the end, maybe the world a better place.

425
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,640
 I think it's an interesting story because really at the end of it, it's all a conspiracy theory.

426
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:24,640
 And rumor, some of them are proven in court, like Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein.

427
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,640
 But a lot of them are just allegations.

428
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:31,640
 And push money is given to families and actresses and actors are just moved to different roles.

429
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:38,640
 Or they just grin and bear it for a bit longer so they can move up themselves in the industry.

430
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,640
 It's a fact. Hollywood is such an insular group.

431
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,640
 It's really hard to break into. And once you're in it, some people will do anything to stay in it.

432
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,640
 But a lot of people will keep their mouths shut to stay in it.

433
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,640
 They see all this horrible stuff happening with people far more powerful than they are,

434
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,640
 and they just keep their mouths shut.

435
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,640
 And that's not the way to go through life.

436
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,640
 It can be very dangerous to do physically.

437
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,640
 It can be very dangerous career-wise.

438
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:10,640
 So you might not be able to fight it head-on, but fight it how you can.

439
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,640
 Fight it how you can.

440
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,640
 Because you can't let the perverts run the world.

441
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:22,640
 Because if we do, then someday we will have a all-pervert controlled government.

442
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,640
 We will have every branch of government across the planet controlled by these sickos.

443
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:38,640
 And we will stand up now who's to say that all of these dreams and fantasies and horrific ideas of this one-world satanic pedophile elite won't come to pass.

444
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,640
 I don't think it exists now.

445
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,640
 But if we don't do anything to stop it, and I'm talking legally, I'm not saying...

446
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,640
 I'm not telling people to load up their rifles and run through the street, but we're not doing anything to stop it now.

447
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,640
 That is the future we could be looking at.

448
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,640
 So is him Robert Downey Jr. who knows?

449
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:03,640
 But if him is telling the truth, he's the real superhero.
