1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 A bizarre sight emerges from a McDonald's dumpster.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,500
 When a man is rescued out of the middle of the ocean, it seems like a miracle.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,760
 But then, someone else is rescued as well.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,960
 Let me take a look at the story of a man who grew up in a small town, a sleepy town, a

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,320
 town with no mysteries, until he realized an entire building vanished overnight.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,320
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,360
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,880
 I hope you guys are strapped in for today's episode.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,840
 First off, coming into Dead Rabbit Command, dressed up as a Centaurion.

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,800
 Now, one of those cool guys from Rome, he's dressed up like one of those 1980s action figures.

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,480
 He's wearing one of those cheap costumes we all used to wear as kids.

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,480
 It's Iscala!

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,480
 Everyone give a round of applause to Iscala.

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,480
 Iscala's like, "Come on man, really?"

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,480
 He's nine years old.

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,240
 He's walking in in a little cheap Centaurion's costume.

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,640
 Iscala, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode if you guys can't support the

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
 Patreon.

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,320
 Or if you're not Power Extreme, that's fine too.

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,280
 Just helps rid the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,760
 Iscala, I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

25
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:29,760
 For Leave Me Behind Dead Rabbit Command, we are headed out to a local McDonald's.

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,600
 Old timey car is driving us out here.

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,880
 This is actually a follow up to yesterday's story.

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,160
 Yesterday's story was about the two dimensional hobo that was floating through the wilderness.

29
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,560
 This story is actually a follow up to that because when Elename, I think that was the

30
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,000
 person's name, posted the story about their experience with a two dimensional hobo, someone

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,440
 else on Reddit had their own story.

32
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,600
 This comes from Dark Lancer 2020.

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,840
 Now in the previous story, we got like a, we got the coordinates so we were able to

34
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,440
 zoom in from space to where the story took place and I applauded that.

35
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,480
 This story, we don't have a location, we don't have a date, so we don't know when this took

36
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
 place.

37
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,520
 But Dark Lancer was at a McDonald's with their teenage sons and they got one of those orders

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,960
 at McDonald's that happens every once in a while where they can't even produce that

39
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,220
 much food.

40
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,960
 So they had to go wait in the parking lot for the order to be finished.

41
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,840
 So they're waiting in the parking lot.

42
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,480
 And this McDonald's has a wooded area around the McDonald's and they see a homeless person

43
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,000
 stand in front of the trees.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 And he's just kind of looking off in the distance.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,560
 And then he begins flapping his arms like a bird and starts going "Khaa, khaa, khaa!"

46
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,680
 Very loudly.

47
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,160
 Dark Lancer's watching this and their teenage sons in the back start laughing.

48
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,120
 They think it's pretty funny to watch this guy pretend to be a bird.

49
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,720
 And then he stops and he walks over to the McDonald's dumpster.

50
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,200
 Now if you guys aren't familiar with McDonald's dumpsters, they stink for one, but I don't

51
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,440
 know how common this is worldwide.

52
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,040
 In America fast food dumpsters, and dumpsters in general, we'll have private businesses,

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,080
 we'll have concrete walls around them.

54
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,280
 So you don't see this unsightly thing, you don't see a bunch of Big Macs overflowing

55
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,880
 from a dumpster as you've just ordered your Big Mac and you're driving away.

56
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,240
 They keep it so it's out of the prying eyes of the public.

57
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,960
 They have these large brick walls that section off the dumpster from the rest of society.

58
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,400
 The homeless man walks over to the dumpster and then a few moments pass and Dark Lancer's

59
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,040
 looking at that.

60
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,760
 And then he says a large black bird emerges from the dumpster.

61
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,960
 "Khaa, khaa, khaa, khaa!"

62
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,360
 They didn't say it sounded like a pterodactyl, they didn't say it sounded menacing, but they

63
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:50,080
 saw a large bird fly away from the dumpster area.

64
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,520
 Now obviously if there's a bird in the dumpster, garbage does attract some birds, someone walks

65
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,920
 over there, their bird's gonna fly away, but Dark Lancer said they're sitting there, they're

66
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,840
 waiting for their food, the homeless man never emerges from the dumpster.

67
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,440
 They're waiting, still nothing.

68
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,400
 Then the food gets brought out to them and they're sitting in the car, homeless man is

69
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,760
 still in the dumpster area.

70
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,680
 Eventually they drive, their food is all cold, they've been waiting there all night, eventually

71
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,480
 they do leave the area, the homeless man never emerged.

72
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:30,040
 And the story ends with quote, "I still to this day believe we witnessed the shapeshifter."

73
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,320
 There's a couple things, I mean obviously like I said if there's a big bird in an area

74
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:42,240
 and you walk over it's gonna fly away, homeless people around dumpsters is an unfortunate reality.

75
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,540
 So I mean that is a place he would go.

76
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,040
 Is this a story of a coincidence?

77
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,680
 Is this a story of a man making bird noises and then going to a place where birds are

78
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,080
 commonly seen and then they didn't wait there forever, right?

79
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,960
 They're not like until this day I'm in my job and I sat here, I live off McDonald's now,

80
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,200
 I work there and then I sit in my car waiting for the homeless man emerge.

81
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,280
 Did the man emerge later?

82
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,060
 Was he eating out of the dumpster which wouldn't logically make sense?

83
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,980
 Did they actually see a shapeshifter?

84
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
 Probably not, right?

85
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,920
 Unfortunately it was probably a guy dumpster diving.

86
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,680
 But this is a paranormal podcast and in the realm that we exist in that would also make

87
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,560
 sense that he's out there making the bird noises and then he's like, "Oh that was probably

88
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,320
 a little too loud, I might have given it away."

89
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,840
 And then he went to a place where prying eyes would not see him.

90
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,480
 Being a homeless person would be the perfect cover for, yesterday we were talking about

91
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,760
 people coming from other dimensions and being mistaken for homeless people, but we've talked

92
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,240
 about this on the show as well, being homeless would be the perfect cover for a cryptid.

93
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,560
 Because people just ignore you anyways.

94
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,360
 People aren't, I mean obviously if you're 8 foot tall, bigfoot, you're going to have

95
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,720
 a hard time walking through San Francisco whether or not you're a homeless person.

96
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,360
 But to a shapeshifter or a creature or something like that, not only would it be a great disguise

97
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,040
 because people will ignore you, it would also be a great feeding ground.

98
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,120
 You may have seen a shapeshifter, you may have just seen a homeless person, you may have

99
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,240
 seen both.

100
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,160
 Probably though was just a homeless person dumpster diving and you went home before he

101
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
 left the dumpster.

102
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,920
 Hey Scullo, let's go ahead and leave this McDonald's.

103
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,680
 I'm going to go and attach the keys to the Dead Rabbit Robo.

104
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,080
 We are headed out to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

105
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,240
 Splash!

106
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,320
 Splash!

107
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,360
 It's November 13th, 1961.

108
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,360
 There's this little dinghy floating in the water and there's a big ship coming by.

109
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,160
 They see a man on this dinghy.

110
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,800
 His name is Julian Harvey and he's cradling a young girl.

111
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,720
 The boat comes up alongside him, gets him on board and they find out that the young girl,

112
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,720
 a 7 year old girl named Renee, has passed away.

113
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,560
 She's dead.

114
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,200
 And Julian Harvey is a 44 year old captain of a boat and they go, "What happened?

115
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,360
 You know, this wasn't your boat, right?

116
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
 You had more of a boat than just this dinghy."

117
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,920
 And he goes, "Yeah guys, listen, this was absolutely terrible."

118
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,520
 And Julian says, "Okay, so here it is.

119
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,960
 I'm the captain of a boat, or was the captain of a boat called the Bluebell and we were

120
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,160
 chartered to take a trip from Fort Lauderdale to the Bahamas.

121
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,040
 The other passengers on board was, I'm recently married, my wife was on board.

122
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,240
 She didn't make it.

123
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,120
 I was chartered by a family, the Dauper Alts.

124
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,480
 There was Arthur and Jean, those were the parents.

125
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,720
 You had Brian, Terry, Joe and Renee, poor little Renee, 7 years old, they didn't make

126
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,720
 it either.

127
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
 Just me.

128
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,440
 And they go, "What happened?"

129
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,480
 He said there was a squall and knocked down the mast of the boat, which ended up rupturing

130
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,960
 an auxiliary gas tank.

131
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,360
 A fire broke out.

132
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,320
 The boat, I couldn't do anything.

133
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,680
 The boat just caught on fire.

134
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
 It started to sink.

135
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,560
 I grabbed Renee out of the water, but everyone else was lost.

136
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,600
 And I thought I had acted quickly enough, but obviously I didn't.

137
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,320
 And he points over to where Renee is laying.

138
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,520
 He goes, "They didn't make it.

139
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
 I'm the only survivor."

140
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,600
 And they go, "That's terrible."

141
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,360
 Three days later, there's a freighter off the coast of Florida and they see something

142
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,840
 in the water.

143
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,720
 This chunk of a boat is just floating there.

144
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,200
 And on top of that is a young girl just floating in the middle of the water.

145
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,280
 They bring her on board.

146
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,720
 She's borderline catatonic.

147
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,960
 She's super dehydrated.

148
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,160
 She has no idea what is going on.

149
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,880
 Eventually she's able to say, "My name is Terry Joe."

150
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,240
 And they airlift her to a hospital in Miami where she can get full treatment.

151
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,400
 So now they know there's two survivors of the Blue Belt Fire.

152
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,640
 And so when authorities let Julian know, "Hey, you won't believe it.

153
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,200
 There's actually been a huge miracle."

154
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,920
 He's like, "What's going on?"

155
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,680
 Terry Joe, the 11-year-old girl from that, she made it too.

156
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
 She's alive.

157
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,440
 It wasn't just you.

158
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,480
 Someone else survived the horrible, what you described, the boat falling apart and catching

159
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,840
 on fire.

160
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,640
 And Julian's like, "Oh my God, that is a miracle.

161
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,720
 That, oh my God.

162
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,120
 I'm so glad because I thought it was done so."

163
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
 That is such a miracle.

164
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,760
 In fact, I'm going to leave my house right now.

165
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,720
 He's like, "Excuse me, officers.

166
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,160
 Excuse me, excuse me.

167
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,320
 I'm going to walk to my car right now, officers.

168
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
 That is such a great miracle.

169
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,760
 I have something to do."

170
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,760
 And they're like, "What?"

171
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,720
 And he goes and he checks into a hotel room.

172
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,520
 And then later that night, he kills himself.

173
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
 Here's what actually happened.

174
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,280
 November 12th, the boats headed back to Fort Lauderdale.

175
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,960
 The trip to the Bahamas is over.

176
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,200
 Everyone had a good time.

177
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,480
 And Terry Joe goes, "You know what, guys?

178
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,600
 I'm going to go down below deck.

179
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,960
 I'm going to take a nap.

180
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,080
 You guys all good up here?"

181
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
 And the family's like, "Yeah."

182
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,080
 And the captain's like, "Yes."

183
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,560
 Terry Joe goes, "That is just perfect.

184
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,720
 I always ask this question when I leave a room, making sure everyone's okay."

185
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,240
 I'm going to go downstairs and take a nap.

186
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,720
 She wakes up later to some horrible commotion going on above deck.

187
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,320
 And she's the only living witness to this story.

188
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,120
 So some stuff is still kind of pieced together because Julianne is dead.

189
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,720
 But she hears this commotion above deck.

190
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,680
 And this is what the authorities have kind of pieced together.

191
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,160
 Julianne had a wife who mysteriously died years prior.

192
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,160
 And he got some insurance money from that.

193
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,680
 So what they believe is Julianne had planned to take his newly-wed wife out on the strip

194
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,760
 with his family and to kill his wife and get away with it.

195
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,280
 But while he killed his wife and goes, "Ah, the perfect plan, the perfect plan," on a

196
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,640
 contained location with several witnesses, I don't know if he knocked her overboard

197
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,800
 or if he poisoned her.

198
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,960
 There's never been any autopsy done.

199
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,200
 But he killed his wife.

200
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:12,440
 And while he was killing his wife, Dr. Arthur, Terry Joe's dad, saw Julianne kill Julianne's

201
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,000
 wife.

202
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,440
 So he has to kill Dr. Arthur now.

203
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:23,400
 And as he's killing Dr. Arthur, Dr. Arthur's wife and their two children, Brian and Renee,

204
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,720
 see him murdering Dr. Arthur.

205
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,240
 So now he has to kill all of them.

206
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,360
 So he tried killing his wife undiscovered.

207
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,880
 It's almost like a game of hitman.

208
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,000
 You have to keep killing the witnesses.

209
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,120
 He kills his wife, gets discovered, kills Dr. Arthur, gets discovered.

210
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,040
 Now asked to kill the remaining three witnesses, the wife and the two kids, Terry Joe wakes

211
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,240
 up as he's murdering her family.

212
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,320
 Her dad had already been murdered and the wife had already been murdered.

213
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,240
 She wakes up when he's murdering the mom and the two other kids.

214
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,440
 Terry Joe had been napping through the whole thing, but she hears this.

215
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,080
 Now she's a witness to this.

216
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,560
 Terry Joe says he stabbed the brother.

217
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,360
 She saw him stab her brother and he threw Renee overboard.

218
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,640
 He threw the seven year old overboard.

219
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,800
 He didn't stab her, but she does die by drowning.

220
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,520
 And he's planning on killing Terry Joe.

221
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,640
 And at the same time, scuttling the boat.

222
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,920
 He's going to make sure that the boat sinks because now things have really gone south.

223
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,480
 As he's trying to scuttle the boat and as he's chasing after Terry with a knife, she

224
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:35,360
 hits the rope and releases his dinghy into the water.

225
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,000
 Now the boat is sinking and Terry Joe is on the other side of the boat and he has this

226
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,280
 knife and he needs the killer, but his dinghy is going to float away if he doesn't act quickly.

227
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,280
 So he jumps in that little boat, grabs Renee and throws her on the boat because that's

228
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,520
 now part of his cover story.

229
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
 So everyone died.

230
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,480
 I was able to hopefully save this girl, but she drowned.

231
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,920
 And he's floating away in his dinghy and he's looking back and Terry Joe is sitting on this

232
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,160
 boat as it's sinking into the ocean.

233
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,040
 And he thought she's never going to make it.

234
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,320
 She doesn't have any supplies.

235
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
 She's in the middle of nowhere.

236
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,960
 She's 11.

237
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,840
 So he figured she just went down with the ship.

238
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,640
 She was able to get some plywood, get some debris from the boat and she just crawled

239
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,840
 on top of it and just floated.

240
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,040
 Now there's obviously an alternate reality where this freighter did not discover her

241
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:35,240
 in time, where either they found her and she was already dead or they never found her.

242
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,800
 But they found her three days later.

243
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:44,520
 She went three days with no food, no water floating on plywood in the middle of the ocean

244
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,440
 and a boat happened to pass by.

245
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,440
 It's a crazy story.

246
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,080
 It's a crazy true crime story.

247
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,560
 And it seems in one sense, I'm not trying to make light of it, but it does seem comedic

248
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,480
 in the sense that the bumbling killer keeps finding more witnesses.

249
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,920
 We've seen stuff like that in comedies before and that is a trope of the Hitman games.

250
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,000
 Like you're like, "Oh great, now I gotta kill the concierge."

251
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,520
 And oh, the waitress saw that.

252
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,580
 So it's like this kind of like thing.

253
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,580
 This was real.

254
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:18,200
 This real family got annihilated by this guy over insurance money.

255
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,440
 And it was each person turn the corner and saw him murdering the last person and then

256
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,440
 he had to take them out.

257
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,720
 And Terry Joe happened to be sleeping through this.

258
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:32,440
 It wasn't till the very end and that bought her enough time to have some sort of plan.

259
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,520
 Even if that plan is, just stay away from the knife as long as I can.

260
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,600
 And whether or not she hit that dingy on accident or if it was some sort of miracle, because

261
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,440
 if she hadn't done that, he would have absolutely killed her and gotten away with it.

262
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,520
 There would have been another tragic lost at sea story.

263
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,440
 He'd gotten away with a previous mysterious death of one of his ex-wives.

264
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,000
 And I think even his ex-wife's mom was in the car, his mother-in-law.

265
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,720
 They both died in a mysterious car accident.

266
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,200
 So this crazy true crime story though.

267
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,160
 A vicious mass murder in the middle of the sea.

268
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:15,320
 And he thought he got away clean until an 11 year old girl clung to life, clung to

269
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,120
 hope that she could bring her family's murderer to justice.

270
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,640
 It's called, I'm going to go and toss you the keys to the Carbinder Copter.

271
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,800
 We're leaving behind, we're waving goodbye to Terry Joe.

272
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,000
 That is an indomitable will.

273
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,360
 We're waving goodbye to Terry Joe.

274
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,920
 We are headed back to, we're not waving goodbye to her while she's on the raft.

275
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,080
 She's an adult woman now.

276
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,920
 We're waving goodbye to her at her house.

277
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,600
 We are headed out to Marietta, Pennsylvania.

278
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,960
 This is one of the stories I like again, because we get a lot of specific locations with this

279
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
 story.

280
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,080
 Photographs of the area.

281
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,600
 I've personally interacted with this dude online.

282
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,560
 So there's a lot of stuff to back it up.

283
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,960
 Is the story accurate?

284
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,080
 Is the story true?

285
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,000
 Are his hypotheses correct?

286
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,200
 We don't know.

287
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,040
 But I do like the fact that I was able to go to Google Earth and this story as well and

288
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,960
 verify this location and try to figure stuff out.

289
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
 I found this online.

290
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,920
 It was from a dude named Opef Ethereal.

291
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,440
 We're going to call this guy Chuck.

292
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,240
 I don't know if that's a real name.

293
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
 I don't know if it is.

294
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,320
 I'm sorry for outing you, but we're going to call this guy Chuck.

295
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,320
 It's 2015 and Chuck grew up in this area of Marietta, Pennsylvania.

296
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:32,200
 It's a quiet little town and he said it's one of those towns that felt a little off.

297
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:38,640
 Something seemed a little paranormal, but that could just be your imagination, right?

298
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,360
 If you look at a tree on a bright sunny day, you go, it's a tree, but that same tree after

299
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,920
 the sunset, it seems gnarled.

300
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:50,160
 It seems dark, not just light-wise, but it seems malicious.

301
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,400
 So it could just be his imagination.

302
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,760
 Could be something underlying in the town.

303
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,160
 But as Chuck grows up in this town, there was a house that sat on the side of the road.

304
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,440
 There's a big field surrounding it.

305
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,480
 And him and his buddies would always play football in this field.

306
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,040
 So he was always in this location as a kid.

307
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:13,880
 And even as an adult, he would walk down this same road because from his house to Marcos,

308
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,760
 the local pizza joint, this was the way he would go.

309
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,240
 You'd go up and down this road.

310
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,880
 He would walk because when he'd go to Marcos, he'd have a couple beers that's being safe.

311
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,440
 You don't want to drink and drive.

312
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,280
 So he's constantly walking up and down the street for years and years and years.

313
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,560
 He's constantly walking back and forth in front of this house.

314
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,720
 He said it was a house like any other house.

315
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,960
 He didn't really pay attention to it.

316
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
 He knew it was there.

317
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,840
 But he didn't really pay attention to it any more so than he would any other house.

318
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,400
 On the other side of the street from this house is the GlaxoSmithKline warehouse.

319
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,840
 So you have this large parking lot on the other side of the street.

320
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,520
 And people who work there if they want to smoke, they're not allowed to smoke at the

321
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,280
 warehouse where they have all these chemicals.

322
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,280
 They have to stand on the sidewalk right by the street to smoke.

323
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,440
 And Chuck would be walking down the street.

324
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,000
 He'd see them from time to time outside smoking.

325
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,720
 As he'd walk by the house, he'd see the people in the house occasionally.

326
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,960
 He'd see there is a family there.

327
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,680
 There's a husband and a wife, two kids, young kids, little kids.

328
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,040
 And the husband had an older blue mustang that he'd see kind of tooling on it every

329
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,640
 once in a while.

330
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,160
 But again, it's nothing that he's really thinking about.

331
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,080
 He's not suspicious of anyone in this house.

332
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,080
 He's not suspicious.

333
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,360
 He's just, you're around something all the time.

334
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,560
 You start to recognize it.

335
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,320
 It's that basic.

336
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,440
 One night, he's walking to Marcos to get some drinks.

337
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,160
 And he sees the husband standing outside the house.

338
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,000
 And Chuck looks at them and the guy kind of looks at Chuck and they just kind of do the

339
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,480
 little nod to each other.

340
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,160
 Like I acknowledge you.

341
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,760
 Go about your merry way, good sir.

342
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
 You know what I mean?

343
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,760
 Like you'll give that nod.

344
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,880
 It kind of like, it's a polite thing to do.

345
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,960
 And Chuck just continues on his way.

346
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,840
 On his way back, Chuck passes the house and this time the blue mustang is there and there's

347
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,920
 a white van parked out front as well.

348
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,400
 The next morning, Chuck wakes up to go to Marcos to get some beer.

349
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,120
 He does mention at this point that he has a bit of a drinking problem at this part of

350
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
 his life.

351
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,560
 Because it's time to get a little bit of the hair of the dog that bit you last night.

352
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,560
 He's waking up in the morning to go to Marcos to get some more beer.

353
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,720
 Has a few beers.

354
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,200
 Get some to bring home.

355
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,640
 And as he's walking down the street, as he's walking down this long stretch of road, he

356
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,040
 notices something.

357
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,840
 Or he doesn't notice something.

358
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,360
 Might be a better way to put it.

359
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,960
 This is a long stretch of road.

360
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:41,000
 And as he's walking down it, he can see in the distance, the house is gone.

361
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,400
 Slowly walking down the road and he sees that the house does not exist anymore.

362
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,680
 Can't really wrap his head around it.

363
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,440
 Is he that drunk this early in the day?

364
00:19:51,440 --> 00:20:00,240
 He gets to the plot of land and he realizes the area is completely covered up in grass.

365
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,520
 It's like nothing was ever there in the first place.

366
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,680
 The gravel driveway, grass.

367
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,880
 The plot of land, grass.

368
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,380
 The house is gone.

369
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:20,280
 The house he had seen just the night previous has been removed from the earth.

370
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,520
 Now across the street is the GlaxoSmithKline warehouse.

371
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,240
 And there are some guys out there smoking cigarettes.

372
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:34,080
 And Chuck walks over there and he goes, "Hey guys, this might sound weird, but what happened

373
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,360
 to that house across the street?"

374
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,400
 The dudes are sitting there smoking the cigarette and they're looking over at this plot of land,

375
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,600
 they don't see anything, and they go, "What are you talking about?

376
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
 What house?"

377
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,800
 Well, I know there's not a house there now, but what happened to the house there?

378
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,360
 I don't know what you're talking about.

379
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,960
 He said the people had no idea what he was talking about.

380
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,960
 So he comes to the subreddit, "The truth is here," which is a really cool subreddit if

381
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,640
 you're into paranormal stuff, to ask, "What could this have been?"

382
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,120
 Now he drops Google Earth photos, he shows the coordinates, the address, you're able

383
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:15,080
 to verify all of this stuff, because he basically wants to be convinced he's not insane, which

384
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,560
 is kind of what we all want.

385
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:24,200
 He goes, "Using Google Earth, I can pull up a photo from 2011," which shows the house.

386
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,120
 The house did exist in 2011.

387
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:35,880
 This story takes place in 2015, but by 2019, you look at a satellite view, there's no house.

388
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,160
 Another user jumped into the subreddit knowing his stand the brain, and he was able to find

389
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,480
 some other photos between 2011 and 2019.

390
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,240
 2019 shows the house was not there, 2011 does show the house.

391
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,560
 Stand the brain says, "Listen, based on photos that I found, these are also all going to

392
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,920
 be posted in the show notes," you're going to look through these links.

393
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:00,760
 Between the year 2014 and 2015, the house was dismantled.

394
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,600
 There was a house there at some point, someone probably bought it, took it apart, they're

395
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,200
 going to build something else on the land, it fell through, but that's what happened.

396
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,120
 Chuck, that's what happened.

397
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:19,560
 Somebody bought the house, it was slowly dismantled, over time, that's how it disappeared.

398
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,400
 Chuck goes, but that doesn't make sense.

399
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,720
 It had been dismantled overnight, 36 hours at the most.

400
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,440
 I saw it when I was walking home one night, and then I walked back.

401
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,760
 He doesn't remember if he saw it on the way walking to Marcos, but when he was walking

402
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,160
 back that next day, he'd seen it the night before, he nodded to the dude, then husband

403
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,920
 in the house, and then he walks to Marcos the next day.

404
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,880
 He can't remember if he saw it walking there, but on the way back he saw that it was indeed

405
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,360
 gone.

406
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:56,720
 Chuck does concede that it could have been dismantled over time, but he didn't see it

407
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,320
 disappear over time.

408
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,040
 A white van that pulled up that night could not have disassembled the entire house, and

409
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:08,560
 for the grass to grow back, for the pavement to not be there, it doesn't make sense.

410
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,200
 Photographs of the house that exist, so we know it's not a figment of the imagination.

411
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,320
 Photographs of the house no longer exist.

412
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,720
 So we know the story isn't made up, the question is, what happened?

413
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,120
 Now us in the paranormal world were obviously thinking Mandela effect, alternate realities,

414
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,680
 time slips, vortexes that he's traveling through all of that stuff.

415
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:37,440
 And that would explain, or at least make sense in the lore, where he was from a reality where

416
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,600
 the house used to exist, and then for whatever reason he traveled to a reality where it doesn't

417
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,080
 exist.

418
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,680
 And that's where he's at now.

419
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:50,400
 It wouldn't explain why the house existed in 2011 in our reality, in photographs that

420
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,480
 we can see and now it doesn't exist.

421
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,440
 So then you start thinking of things like the house did exist, but it got swallowed up by

422
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,800
 some sort of vortex.

423
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,120
 It disappeared overnight.

424
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,560
 Chuck wasn't the traveler to an alternate reality, the house was, and everyone in it.

425
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,840
 But there's no reports of missing people in the area.

426
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,440
 But again, if we're talking about quantum realities and things like that, maybe Mandela

427
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:20,280
 effect, people don't notice the families missing and all that stuff, we can go down these paths.

428
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,600
 And that's what we do because we enjoy talking about this type of stuff.

429
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,080
 But this story opens the world up to something even more disturbing, I think.

430
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:34,480
 It's the idea of the world passing you by and you not even noticing it.

431
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,960
 Like this man, the most rational answer is this man, Chuck, walked up and down the street

432
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,160
 for a year as the house was slowly being disassembled by the new owners.

433
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,120
 They were disassembling it, they were tearing it down.

434
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,160
 And he was in such a state of mind, whether it was because the alcohol was blurring everything

435
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,280
 or he was just not paying attention to his surroundings as much as he thinks he is, that

436
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:05,080
 a house could be demolished over the course of days or weeks and he doesn't notice it.

437
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,280
 And I find that creepier.

438
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,960
 Well, not necessarily creepier, like a house getting sacked in a vortex and that family

439
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,920
 being in another reality, not of their own.

440
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,480
 That's creepy on a theoretical level.

441
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,600
 We can imagine how creepy that would be.

442
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,840
 And you always hear parents say, "Yeah, turn around and my kid was 11 years old."

443
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,120
 Like, "I swear my wife just came home from the hospital the other day and now it's like

444
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
 that."

445
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
 And I can't comprehend that.

446
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,080
 I can't comprehend that because I don't have kids, but they say time just passes you

447
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,080
 by.

448
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,920
 But it's even, this is the equivalent of you coming home, there's an 11-year-old kid,

449
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,600
 you didn't even know you had a kid.

450
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,280
 "Hi, Dad.

451
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,280
 You want to help me with my homework?"

452
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,600
 And you're like, "Who are you now as you get into my house?"

453
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,920
 This is a complete wipe of a memory, of a year's worth of memories gone.

454
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:58,760
 There may not be a paranormal answer to it, it may just be being not aware of your surroundings,

455
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,080
 not present in your own life.

456
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,560
 You have one existence and you're not even paying attention to what's going on in your

457
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,560
 life.

458
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,400
 Now, the fate of this home, it's not like you had to stand out there and take a photo

459
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,280
 of the house every day to remember it.

460
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,800
 I'm not saying that you have to remember everything, but this troubled him so much that he actually

461
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
 thought there was a paranormal answer to it.

462
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,240
 And there may be.

463
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,360
 There may have been.

464
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:27,040
 But now that we're on this path here, he's so troubled by it, he's looking for help in

465
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:33,280
 the paranormal world where the answer may have actually been he had a drinking problem.

466
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:39,560
 And his brain was more focused on consuming alcohol than it was to noticing the world,

467
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:45,480
 something that had been there since his childhood, being removed and destroyed.

468
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,640
 It's one thing to be plucked out of your reality into another dimension, against your will,

469
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,640
 or for you to build some sort of device and you're looking at the other scientists and

470
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,800
 you hit the button to test it in another reality.

471
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:01,880
 It's another thing to be in this reality, the real world, and having your mind so clouded,

472
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,360
 you can't even tell what's real anymore.

473
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,240
 That to me is more disturbing.

474
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,320
 That's a process could happen for weeks.

475
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,000
 And to you, it seems like it's just the day.

476
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,400
 You don't even know that it happened.

477
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,200
 When you're puzzled about this from 2015 to 2021, you spend six years trying to figure

478
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,600
 out what could have possibly have gone wrong.

479
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,280
 That's disturbing on a different level.

480
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,680
 It's disturbing on a different level.

481
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:37,880
 And I think you would find some peace if it was a paranormal answer.

482
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,280
 Right?

483
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,000
 If you had an alcohol problem or any sort of drug problem or any sort of emotional

484
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 issue, you're so wrapped up in some other thing going on, a personal issue going on

485
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,040
 that you can't even realize how the world is changing around you, whatever it is.

486
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,280
 The paranormal answer would be the comforting one.

487
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,200
 The idea that, oh, there's no proof that this house ever existed.

488
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,720
 Maybe you imagined it.

489
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,840
 Maybe it is the Mandela effect glitch in the matrix.

490
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,420
 I think the more, that would at least give you some comfort to go, well, I mean, I remember

491
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,000
 the house, but there's no photographs of the house ever and no one in the area remembers

492
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 the house.

493
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Maybe I imagined it.

494
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Maybe it was a dream.

495
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,040
 Maybe it was something paranormal versus I suffered such mental decay between 2014 and

496
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,040
 2015.

497
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:29,500
 An entire house that I knew since childhood was dismantled and I can't remember it.

498
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:36,640
 It has less theoretical implications as being distressing, but it's more disturbing in the

499
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,240
 real world.

500
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,380
 The truth of the matter is you don't need a ghost or a goblin or an alien invasion or

501
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:48,980
 a spooky mirror or anything out of the paranormal handbook to be disturbing.

502
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,080
 I hope for Chuck's sake that something paranormal did happen.

503
00:28:52,080 --> 00:29:00,140
 It would actually probably be easier to live with than to know that he lost a year of time.

504
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:05,020
 Because if it happened once, who's to say it's not going to happen again?

505
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:13,600
 How many other times throughout his life will Chuck see such radical changes that he thinks

506
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:21,840
 it's paranormal versus just he's not taking care of himself?

507
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,660
 So Chuck, if you're listening to this, I hope you're doing better.

508
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,440
 I wish you a long and healthy life.

509
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,780
 And I also hope it's paranormal.

510
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:55,860
 Because if it's not, it's just too sad.

511
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:02,860
 I hope you're doing better.

512
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:13,060
 I hope you're doing better.

513
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:23,220
 I hope you're doing better.

514
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,800
 (upbeat music)

515
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:35,800
