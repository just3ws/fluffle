1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
 It's a blast from the past on today's episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:11,480
 First off, we check into a hotel that was built in the 1960s, but everything is not

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,280
 as groovy as it seems.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,640
 And then we travel to an orphanage in the 1930s where kids are being mistreated.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,240
 They languish away on cots in the attic.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:33,960
 Well, what happens when this orphanage is turned into a family's home today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:41,680
 [Music]

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,080
 I'm your host, Jason Garbender.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,080
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,240
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,920
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun out there in the world.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,000
 We got a lot of stuff to cover, so we're gonna get started right away.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,760
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command is our newest Patreon supporter.

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,440
 He's the groovyest of all the babies.

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,560
 Everyone give it up for William Kerman.

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,560
 Woohoo!

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,560
 Yeah!

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
 Dun-uh-nuh-nuh.

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,560
 Dun-uh-nuh-nuh-nuh.

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
 He's walking in.

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,280
 He's dressed up in his cheap Austin Powers costume.

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,360
 That's the only past thing I can think of for some reason.

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,280
 I don't know, maybe William is dressed as a Roman Centurion.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,720
 But William, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,360
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

27
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,360
 That's fine too.

28
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,600
 It's really groovy if you can.

29
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,760
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,320
 That also really helps out a lot.

31
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,320
 It's shagglicious.

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,480
 William, let's go ahead and get this episode started, this blast from the past episode.

33
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,120
 I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy we're gonna leave behind

34
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,520
 Dead Rabbit Command.

35
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,920
 Drive us all the way out too.

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,920
 Ohio.

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,880
 Specifically, we're gonna head out to Southern Ohio.

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,680
 I don't know if that's not super specific.

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,360
 You're like, "Okay, the bottom half of the state.

40
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
 Real great directions."

41
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
 It's the year 1996.

42
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,040
 I got this story off a website called Phantoms and Monsters.

43
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,400
 It's an amazing website.

44
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,120
 Link to the story will be in the show notes.

45
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,560
 In 1996 in Southern Ohio, there were two traveling workers that had to take care of some business

46
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
 in the area.

47
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,560
 They don't give their names.

48
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,960
 We're gonna go ahead and call them the main character, the guy who told the story.

49
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,800
 We're gonna call him Charles and then he has a coworker named Jake.

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,120
 They're traveling through the area.

51
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,920
 They're doing their job.

52
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,440
 Then they decide to get a motel room.

53
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,880
 They're like, "We've been working three days straight.

54
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,560
 The meth has powered us."

55
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,680
 But at this point, we probably should catch them Z.

56
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,640
 They stopped at this motel and Charles said, "It was a small motel."

57
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,680
 He probably estimated around 30 rooms in this motel.

58
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,800
 He goes, "It was one of those that looked like it was built in the '50s.

59
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,520
 It was old-timey, not like super old-timey, not like swinging saloon doors on like a guy

60
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,520
 on the piano.

61
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,400
 Not the 1850s, just the 1950s.

62
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,720
 The time of the madmen and building buildings."

63
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,080
 That's what they did back then.

64
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,440
 This hotel seemed to be built in the 1950s.

65
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,840
 Then Charles and Jake, they go to the front desk, they check in, scribble, scribble, scribble.

66
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,040
 Their name's down in the book, all that good stuff.

67
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,560
 They get their key for their hotel room.

68
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,560
 Charles goes, "Listen, I've stayed in a lot of hotels here in my life.

69
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,000
 I kind of know what I want.

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,400
 I want a hotel room that's the farthest away from the front counter.

71
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,640
 It's really hard to smoke meth if there's a guy working right next to you."

72
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,280
 No, I don't think he really specifies why he wanted far away, but you don't want cars

73
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,280
 pulling up constantly.

74
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,640
 It wouldn't make sense, because that's going to be the busiest part of the motel, is the

75
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,160
 check-in place, so get away from there.

76
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:55,360
 Anyways, he and his coworker, they get the room farthest away from the clerk.

77
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,440
 It'll hurt his feelings when they walk in there like, "We'd like a room, but nowhere

78
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
 near you."

79
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,280
 He's like, "Aww."

80
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:09,960
 They walk into the hotel room, and Charles is immediately struck by the fact that this

81
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,640
 entire room is retro.

82
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,800
 This entire room has been fitted with 1960s decor.

83
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,880
 Retro was a big thing in the 1990s.

84
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,360
 I remember it was like the '50s and '60s.

85
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,120
 Austin Powers, obviously, started cursing the world with his presence in the late '90s.

86
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,840
 Nowadays, the retro movement is like '80s and '90s.

87
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,120
 But in the '90s, it was the '60s.

88
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,960
 And they walk in, and he goes, "It was odd.

89
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,880
 We weren't told that this was a theme hotel, but we walk into the room.

90
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,800
 Everything's decked out in 1960s.

91
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,840
 The curtains, the furniture, the carpet, the wallpaper, everything."

92
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,000
 But it wasn't just that.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,440
 He said he noticed two other interesting details that really sold the retro flair.

94
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,160
 One, the technology was also from the 1960s.

95
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,160
 So the phone and the television set.

96
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:15,320
 It's one thing to have shag carpets and a groovy wallpaper, but I won't be able to pick

97
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
 up the phone.

98
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,440
 Well, it's funny, in the 1990s, we still had wired phones.

99
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,680
 I had wired phones.

100
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
 Some of them were cordless.

101
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,160
 If you were rich, if you had $100 to drop, you'd get yourself a cordless phone.

102
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,720
 But I want to watch television on a watch in the 1990s.

103
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,920
 Now that I remember, I also still had, we still had this big, thick television set.

104
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,680
 So the really difference between a giant CRT television set and a wood panel TV on those

105
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,240
 little wooden legs, like you see from photos from the '60s, the picture quality would be

106
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,120
 slightly better on a 1996 television set.

107
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,880
 So I want to be that big of a problem.

108
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,360
 But basically, you walk, it was weird though.

109
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,680
 It was weird to see retro technology, the phone and the television and the fridge and

110
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,720
 everything.

111
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
 That was a weird detail.

112
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,000
 And it was also odd.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,560
 This is super interesting, right?

114
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,800
 He kind of, I don't know if he realized all of this stuff right away.

115
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,720
 It could have been as time passed, he was kind of having this memory.

116
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,200
 I don't know if I'd be able to take in all these details right away.

117
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,480
 He walks into the room.

118
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,320
 Just 100% retro, ceiling to floor.

119
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,200
 The technology is of the time period of the 1960s.

120
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,120
 And he said it was all new.

121
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,200
 It was all new.

122
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,920
 Now I understand if you're going to put together a retro room, you're not going to have like

123
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,200
 cracked wallpaper, a busted up couch, remember?

124
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,760
 This is a motel in southern Ohio.

125
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,200
 This wasn't some museum piece.

126
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,880
 This wasn't something, this wasn't a set from a television set.

127
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,760
 I would challenge you to go to a normal hotel today and find everything brand new.

128
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,920
 Telephones never work when I'm there.

129
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,360
 Actually, it's so funny, not to think about it.

130
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,800
 Don't most hotels, their phones are still corded.

131
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,560
 But anyways, he said everything looked new.

132
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,160
 Which is not what you would expect in a motel.

133
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,800
 Especially if everything in it is from the 1960s.

134
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,960
 Where did they get all this stuff?

135
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,040
 The retro thing was a retro craze at the time.

136
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:35,840
 But it would be expensive to buy a bunch of new or new looking 1960s stuff just to decorate

137
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,760
 this tiny motel.

138
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,040
 And again, they were not told at any point it was a themed hotel.

139
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,880
 Charles and Jake, they walk into this room.

140
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:52,240
 Everything looked like it's right out of the 1960s.

141
00:07:52,240 --> 00:08:00,760
 As they're walking into this motel room, the bathroom door opens up.

142
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,440
 The bathroom door opens up and Charles and Jake immediately catches their attention.

143
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
 This is their motel room.

144
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,560
 There's not supposed to be anybody else in here.

145
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:19,280
 The bathroom door opens up and out of the bathroom steps a 20-something year old woman

146
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,360
 screaming her head off.

147
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:30,440
 She's absolutely terrified that there are these two gentlemen standing in this room.

148
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,680
 And it takes Charles and Jake back, right?

149
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,480
 Obviously they have no ill intentions.

150
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,720
 They are entering the room that they just got from the clerk.

151
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:46,200
 They turn this woman in her 20s, steps out of the bathroom, begins screaming out them,

152
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
 and they immediately leave.

153
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
 They're like, "Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

154
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
 I'm so sorry."

155
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,320
 And they immediately leave and they're walking back to the clerk and they assume that they've

156
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
 been double booked.

157
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,280
 I feel really bad about it, right?

158
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
 Nobody likes scaring.

159
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,280
 I mean, that's not true.

160
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,320
 I think it's kind of funny.

161
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,360
 But you wouldn't want to scare someone on accent.

162
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,720
 That's actually kind of funny too.

163
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,080
 In this situation, you don't want to scare a random stranger by appearing in her room.

164
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
 We'll say that.

165
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,240
 I'll draw the line there.

166
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,720
 They feel bad about it.

167
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,960
 They're walking to the clerk's office and they tell him, "What happened?

168
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,760
 Hey, man, I think you double booked us because we went into that room and this woman came

169
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,320
 out of the bathroom and she's freaking out."

170
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,440
 And the clerk goes, "No, that's impossible.

171
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
 I believe you guys.

172
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,000
 You guys are trying to get your money back in some weird scheme.

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,880
 I'll go check it out for you, but we only have three rooms checked out.

174
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,440
 There's no reason why we would double book.

175
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,720
 It has to be an accident."

176
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,040
 So he returns to the room with Charles and Jake and they walk back there.

177
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,080
 The farthest room away, the clerk knocks.

178
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
 Is anyone in there?

179
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,280
 Is anyone in there?

180
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
 There's no response.

181
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,440
 The clerk opens the door and steps into the room.

182
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,520
 There's no one there.

183
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,800
 There's no one there.

184
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,760
 And Charles and Jake, they now step into the motel room.

185
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,200
 It's a completely modern room.

186
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:21,440
 Normal bland wallpaper, modern television, modern phone, modern everything.

187
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
 Clerk goes, "No one's here.

188
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,600
 I don't know what that was.

189
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
 I'm sorry.

190
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,200
 I don't even know how to explain that.

191
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,440
 I hope you guys have a good night."

192
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,200
 And the clerk leaves.

193
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,120
 What's interesting is, as Charles thought more about this experience, everything happened

194
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
 so fast.

195
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,120
 When they walked into the room, the first time they were kind of able to take in what was

196
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,360
 going on, they noticed all of the designs were retro and the technology was retro.

197
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,200
 When the woman came out of the bathroom, it shocked them.

198
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
 They didn't expect anyone to be in there.

199
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,520
 But as Charles thought more about the story and was trying to remember what was going on,

200
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,640
 there was another peculiar detail.

201
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:11,680
 The woman who came out of the bathroom, her clothing was of the 1960s era with a hairdo

202
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,280
 to match.

203
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,680
 What's interesting about this?

204
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,480
 Let's take the story of face value, right?

205
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,740
 Let's say that him and Jake actually experienced this.

206
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,440
 This is something that is often implied with time slips, and we might have covered it once

207
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
 or twice.

208
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,280
 It's often implied with time slips, but it's rarely set out right.

209
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,860
 And it's that the slip happens both ways.

210
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,200
 This is actually how he ended his testimonial.

211
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,840
 Charles wrote, "I believe we stepped into a glitch in time that day.

212
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:56,260
 I often wonder if by chance some young woman was scared to death seeing a couple of strange

213
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:02,380
 looking men in her room in the 1960s."

214
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,300
 That would be her experience, right?

215
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,700
 It would be a time slip.

216
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,780
 She's in this super modern room.

217
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,660
 It has all the latest advancements in technology that a motel can afford.

218
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,260
 She goes to the bathroom and she's walking out now.

219
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:24,880
 She's done her business and there's just two dudes standing in your room.

220
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,440
 And you scream and they leave.

221
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,160
 And then you go to the clerk and you go, "Oh my God, some guy's broken."

222
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,720
 And maybe the police are called.

223
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,320
 Maybe, right?

224
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,880
 Maybe the clerk is just like, "Well, it's so funny to see on our end, the way Charles

225
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,400
 is looking at it is he is looking into a knowable past.

226
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,920
 We know what the fashion is.

227
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,080
 We know what the technology is.

228
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,060
 We know what the decor looked like in the 1960s."

229
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,900
 So if you, you wouldn't press the issue.

230
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,740
 If you went into the room and he saw us from the 1960s and then a girl from the 1960s came

231
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,300
 running out of a room and you ran away and then you came back in the room as normal,

232
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,820
 you could kind of understand that you would think it could be mental illness or hallucination.

233
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,740
 But you could also go, "Oh, what if that was one of those time slips I've heard about?"

234
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,540
 "I've read about the New York Times.

235
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,860
 I said be careful this Thursday.

236
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,860
 Time slips."

237
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,240
 It's toast.

238
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,640
 But flip it around.

239
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:27,120
 A woman in the 1960s, if she saw two men wearing clothes from 1996, she would have, she would

240
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,020
 not be thinking, "Oh, these must be visitors from the future who are in my room."

241
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,840
 She would just see two dudes and freak out.

242
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,240
 It would be a totally different experience.

243
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:47,020
 Unless they were straight up wearing like spaceman suits, if you came to your home tonight,

244
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:54,500
 you get off work, you come home and there's a guy wearing like a lime green tie, blue

245
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:02,780
 jeans and a t-shirt that says "Poka Poka."

246
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,900
 After you get done beating this guy to death at the baseball bat, well you keep swinging

247
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,240
 and he's able to avoid you, he's super fast.

248
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,060
 And he jumps out the window and runs away.

249
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,680
 You would assume that guy was a weirdo, you would assume that guy was some sort of homeless

250
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,960
 bum who broke into your house, you would assume that, you would assume a hundred different

251
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,640
 things, but you wouldn't assume, "Oh, it must have just been a time slip and that's how

252
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,620
 people will address in the future."

253
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:34,120
 But to the person in the "Poka Poka" shirt, that's the newest craze sweeping America, when

254
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,500
 he came home to his house in the year 2045 and time slipped into yours, which is the

255
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,540
 same house, and he saw you walk in, he goes, "Well, that's weird.

256
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,740
 I walked into my home and it had a bunch of technology from 2022.

257
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,020
 It was super weird."

258
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,340
 And then this guy came in dressed up and he looked like he was wearing clothes from 2023

259
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:00,900
 and that bat definitely, that technology has never advanced much, it hasn't had to.

260
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,580
 And then I jumped out a window and the next thing I was, you know what I mean, like the

261
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:08,200
 different versions, one person had to go, "Wow, that was a really bizarre paranormal

262
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
 event.

263
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,000
 I slipped through time."

264
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,200
 But the person in the past seeing that would be like, "Oh my God, a bunch of weirdos just

265
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,920
 showed up in my room."

266
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,420
 It's a fascinating story because of the time slip would work both ways.

267
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,940
 One person would have the privilege of knowledge to say that was just the time slip and the

268
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,120
 other person, it's just a horrifying event.

269
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,280
 Some people they don't recognize in clothes they can't understand.

270
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,820
 I mean, these guys, we don't know if these guys were wearing like flannel shirts and

271
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,100
 ripped jeans or they were wearing suits.

272
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,580
 Obviously they wore suits.

273
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,340
 In the 1960s, just the cut of the clothing, just the material, the hairstyles, all that

274
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,300
 stuff would look radically different.

275
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:51,620
 You may, and that's if they're wearing suits, if they were wearing t-shirts with designs

276
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,460
 that no, we don't know what they were doing for a living.

277
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,620
 They may have been roadies, they may have been traveling salesmen, we don't know.

278
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,680
 Better installers, their clothing could be not incomprehensible.

279
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,200
 It's not like you have a shirt that's the madness of Cthulhu, but you know what I mean.

280
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:12,800
 If you went back in time and you were wearing a shirt that had a picture of Bart Simpson,

281
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,000
 it's not like people would be like, "I can't understand why their head would explode."

282
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,160
 But people would have a heart, they'd be like, "Yeah, this guy just was in my house in the

283
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,080
 middle of the night and he had the shirt on that said, 'Don't have a cow man.'"

284
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,640
 And it was this little yellow kid.

285
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,700
 Like, I don't know what that is.

286
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,700
 I have no idea what that is.

287
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,700
 You'd have no, you'd obviously figure it was a drawing or something like that.

288
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,580
 You're like, "I need my meds, I need my meds."

289
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,580
 I saw a drawing, huh?

290
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,140
 Don't open the Sunday paper, ma'am.

291
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,780
 You totally lose your mind.

292
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,780
 But you know what I mean.

293
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,660
 The visuals, the clothes.

294
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,660
 Fascinating.

295
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,340
 Fascinating story.

296
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:52,780
 Our fun time slip is another person's horrifying nightmare.

297
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,800
 William Kerman, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carvener Coptor.

298
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,520
 We are leaving behind Southern Ohio.

299
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:10,480
 Fly us all the way out to the big city.

300
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,760
 How big of a city?

301
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
 Not for sure.

302
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,440
 Specific location?

303
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,440
 Not for sure.

304
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,880
 This story was posted online by someone going by the name "Undercooked Band-Aid."

305
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,540
 They were actually told this story by their mother.

306
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,980
 That's who we're really interested in.

307
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,980
 She doesn't give her name.

308
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,980
 We're going to go ahead and call the mother Tracy.

309
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,980
 This is Tracy's experience.

310
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:38,020
 This is a pretty cool story here.

311
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:45,100
 Tracy and her husband, let's call him Bill, are visiting a friend.

312
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,540
 A friend of theirs named Mary recently got married.

313
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:56,360
 Tracy and Bill and Mary and her new husband and a score of other people are all at Tracy's

314
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,860
 house for a housewarming party.

315
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,720
 She had recently moved into this new house.

316
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,640
 Everything is just going great for all of these young couples.

317
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,740
 They're starting life together.

318
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:18,000
 As they're on the tour of this house, Bill starts to notice that Tracy is sweating.

319
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,680
 Her eyes are darting from side to side.

320
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:27,500
 You know something's wrong with his wife, but he can't really figure out what it is.

321
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:39,740
 But by the time Tracy rolls down a giant set of stairs, hits the ground, and then jumps

322
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:49,660
 up and sprints out of the house, Bill realizes that something went seriously wrong.

323
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:55,560
 Somewhere along this tour, he didn't think his wife was capable of this, but after watching

324
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:02,040
 her fall down several stairs and then without wasting a breath, breaking into a full sprint,

325
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,600
 he follows her out of the house.

326
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,800
 When he gets out, Tracy is lighting a cigarette.

327
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:14,720
 This cigarette she always kept behind her ear, just in situations like this.

328
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,840
 Not stair falling situations, but stressful situations.

329
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,300
 She always has at least one cigarette tucked behind her ear.

330
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,340
 When Bill comes out of the house, Tracy is standing there on the sidewalk, lighting that

331
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:29,140
 cigarette and taking a deep drag of it, trying to calm her nerves.

332
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,500
 Bill is worried.

333
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,140
 That's the first emotion he can really think.

334
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,020
 If he walks up to Tracy, he goes, "Tracy, oh my God, what happened?

335
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,940
 I saw you fall down the stairs and you just ran out of the house.

336
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:47,300
 You looked like you were a little uneasy, but what happened?"

337
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:55,380
 Tracy turns to her husband and says, "I never told you about the dream."

338
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,260
 When Tracy was a child, she had this reoccurring dream.

339
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,500
 It didn't happen every night, but it happened.

340
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:09,340
 It repeated and it was always the same dream.

341
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:15,020
 Tracy was in the dream.

342
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,060
 She was a social worker.

343
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:22,340
 Based on the clothes she was wearing and the environment that she was walking through,

344
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:28,300
 Tracy when she was awake, she kind of surmised that this dream took place in the 1930s.

345
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,900
 That would be her best guess.

346
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,860
 Tracy is a social worker and she's working in the old part of the city.

347
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,460
 At that time, it would have been the new part of the city.

348
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:44,100
 Her job as a social worker was to make sure that children were getting the care that they

349
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,100
 needed.

350
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,740
 She may be working in a home.

351
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,620
 One week, she may be investigating child abuse allegations.

352
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:57,780
 Another, and on this particular day in this dream, it was her job to go check on an orphanage.

353
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:04,740
 When this dream starts, she is walking into this orphanage.

354
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:12,540
 Tracy begins to make her way around the house and there's this long staircase in the house.

355
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:19,260
 She walks up the staircase and it leads to the second floor.

356
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,620
 And then if you continue walking up the staircase, it leads to an attic.

357
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,860
 An attic, I think is how it's normally pronounced.

358
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,580
 An attic, it's that broom in the ceiling of your house.

359
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,380
 If you have no idea what word I'm saying, an attic.

360
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:41,860
 When Tracy continues walking up the staircase, she gets to the attic door and she opens it

361
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:50,860
 up and inside she sees, as Tracy is walking up the stairs, she sees near the top of the

362
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,340
 stairs this giant stained glass window.

363
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:02,460
 She continues to walk up to where the staircase leads to a door that leads into the attic.

364
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:14,460
 And she walks up and she opens the door and almost in utter darkness was little kids on

365
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,780
 cots.

366
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,740
 She sees all of these orphans on these cots and they're pleading for help.

367
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,740
 They're malnourished.

368
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,860
 Visibly, you can tell that they're sick.

369
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,060
 They're also in the attic.

370
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,860
 I mean, that's a pretty good indicator that they're not being taken care of.

371
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:33,020
 We have all these cots and all these kids and they're crying out for help.

372
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,700
 And just at that moment, the matron of the orphanage.

373
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,420
 I don't know what the actual word is for that.

374
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:45,580
 But the matron of the orphanage shows up and says, "Oh my God, oh my God, you can't tell

375
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,260
 anyone about this room.

376
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,580
 They'll shut us down."

377
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,540
 And if they shut down the orphanage, then where will the rest, where will the healthy

378
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540
 orphans go?

379
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,460
 Those healthy orphans, they have a chance.

380
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,460
 You know what?

381
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,820
 Them out on the street and Tracy is furiously scribbling notes in her pad.

382
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,180
 And she begins to walk down the stairs.

383
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,700
 She's like, "No, I have to report you.

384
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,700
 What are you talking about?

385
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,900
 Those kids are prisoner up there and they're so malnourished.

386
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,900
 They're sick.

387
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,900
 They need help.

388
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,180
 We will work this out, but I need to report this to my superiors."

389
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:24,940
 And as she's walking down the stairs, she hears the matron of the orphanage hiss, "You

390
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,100
 pig!"

391
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:35,060
 And then she feels a hand push against her back and Tracy begins to tumble down the long

392
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,420
 staircase.

393
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,180
 That's when she would wake up.

394
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,180
 Every single time.

395
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:46,140
 That's when the dream would end.

396
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,260
 And she's standing outside of this building smoking the cigarette.

397
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,100
 Her husband has never heard this story before.

398
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,300
 She never told him about the dream because it was a recurring dream as she was a child,

399
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,660
 but by the time she was a teenager, she stopped having the dream.

400
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,660
 Now she's in her early 20s.

401
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,420
 And it's not, "When are you going to tell your husband about this?"

402
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,900
 You never would have thought about it again.

403
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:21,420
 But now they're standing outside the house that Tracy had always seen in her dream.

404
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:26,260
 She goes, "Bill, listen, when we walked into this house, I got this dream.

405
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,540
 It's a really weird feeling.

406
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,300
 I didn't know where to place it.

407
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,300
 I just felt weird.

408
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,100
 We're meeting all these really nice people.

409
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:39,420
 We're in the company of friends, but something fell off."

410
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,940
 But whatever.

411
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:47,100
 And then Mary says, "Hey guys, I'm going to give you a tour."

412
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,100
 Showed us around.

413
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:53,180
 Everything was fine, but then we got to the first step of that staircase.

414
00:24:53,180 --> 00:25:02,180
 And I swear to God, Bill, I knew something was seriously wrong.

415
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:10,380
 We started walking up that staircase and I saw that stained glass at the top of the staircase.

416
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:17,940
 When I saw that stained glass window, I knew that I had seen it before.

417
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,100
 That's when it clicked.

418
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,220
 That's when it clicked.

419
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:34,100
 That's when I realized that this was the house that I died in.

420
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:41,020
 Because in Tracy's view, that reoccurring dream, you know, as a child, you would have

421
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,820
 no context for it.

422
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,460
 You would think it was just a dream, but at some point, either because she had the dream

423
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:53,340
 so many times or because now she was in this building for real, Tracy started to think,

424
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,020
 this wasn't just a random dream.

425
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,000
 This was my past life.

426
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,580
 This was the building that I died in in a past life.

427
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,940
 But as she's walking up the stairs, as Tracy is walking up the stairs in real life and

428
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,580
 she sees that stained glass window, you still have to think maybe this is just a coincidence.

429
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:18,140
 Maybe this isn't what I think it is, but when they go all the way up the staircase, and

430
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:23,260
 this is when Bill looks over and notices that Tracy's looking really, really sweaty,

431
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,820
 that something's wrong with Tracy, but I mean, he's not thinking.

432
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:33,700
 He's not thinking that she's in the home she died in over 100 years ago.

433
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,020
 Mary opens the door that leads to the attic and now it's a room.

434
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:43,580
 It's not that they've converted it, it's no longer a storage space just for all your junk.

435
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:48,380
 It's a room and she goes, yeah, this place used to be the attic, but we're turning it

436
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:52,180
 into another room.

437
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:58,060
 And Tracy looks into that room, a room that she had seen dozens of times as a child, if

438
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,700
 not more.

439
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:09,180
 She looks into this room and she sees in the corner of the room stacked up against the

440
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:18,260
 wall some old cots.

441
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,140
 Mary goes, yeah, the place used to actually be an orphanage a long time ago, back in

442
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:27,780
 the early 1900s, but when they moved out, they still had all this stuff in here, they

443
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,380
 even left these cots.

444
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,900
 At this point, Tracy's done with it.

445
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,540
 Tracy is the tourist over for her.

446
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:41,780
 She's done and she turns and she starts to walk down the stairs very shakily, walk down

447
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:46,860
 the stairs and she has that cigarette out of the back of her ear and she goes, I need

448
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,380
 a smoke, I need to get some fresh air and smoke.

449
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,140
 And as she's walking down the stairs, her husband Bill, who's just confused, he doesn't

450
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:59,500
 know what's going on, he says to her, he says to her this exact quote as she's walking on

451
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,820
 the stairs, reaching for that cigarette.

452
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:06,420
 Bill says, I don't like when you have that cigarette behind your ear.

453
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:12,020
 It makes you look like a pig.

454
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:19,420
 And when she heard that word pig come out of his mouth as she had her back to him, as

455
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:24,420
 she's walking down these stairs, as she needs to get out of this building, when she hears

456
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,580
 him say pig, she completely loses it.

457
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:35,020
 With the last remaining grasp she had on reality just disappeared and she was free falling

458
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:41,060
 mentally and physically because once he said pig, it was almost like a psionic blast.

459
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:46,420
 She lost her balance and began rolling down the stairs in the middle of this housewarming

460
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:52,740
 party and when she hit the ground, she took off running.

461
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,780
 And that's when Bill followed her outside.

462
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:59,980
 And that's when she told Bill about the dream.

463
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,940
 Now what I think is so fat, I love this story.

464
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,500
 I absolutely love this story.

465
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,860
 It's interesting on a couple different levels.

466
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:13,260
 One, obviously we have a reincarnation aspect to this, which I don't think she ever really

467
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,900
 considered as a child.

468
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,620
 I think once the dream stopped, she just stopped thinking about them.

469
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,700
 I don't think when she would wake up when she was seven or nine or whenever, however

470
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:29,460
 old she was, it started young and they went away before she got out of her teens.

471
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,220
 I don't think she ever woke up and goes, "Wow, that must have been how I died in a past life."

472
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,980
 She may have had that thought, but it was probably just a weird reoccurring dream and

473
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,780
 she didn't know what it was.

474
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:46,780
 So you have that and then when you visited the house in real life and you start to realize,

475
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,020
 okay, that wasn't just a dream.

476
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:54,500
 That 100% was some sort of past life experience.

477
00:29:54,500 --> 00:30:00,580
 Now I'm in that house that I dreamt about, that I've never been to before.

478
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:06,060
 I'm not only in that house in real life, but it is confirmed to me that this house used

479
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:14,140
 to be an orphanage.

480
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,180
 You're putting too many pieces together.

481
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,780
 She sees the cots stacked up as garbage.

482
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,540
 When she had the stream, she saw the cots laid out and there were these little kids being

483
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,540
 treated like garbage.

484
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,860
 But what's the most interesting point?

485
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,140
 I mean, it's all interesting, right?

486
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,740
 Past life stuff when it's cool.

487
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,220
 I find it super interesting.

488
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,220
 Sometimes it's lame.

489
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,620
 Past life stuff is cool.

490
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,780
 I'm not a huge dream fan.

491
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:49,660
 But one of the details I like most about this story is the pig line.

492
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,260
 Because that doesn't even make sense.

493
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,020
 I mean, for the old lady to call her a pig and push her, that makes sense because the

494
00:30:55,020 --> 00:31:01,380
 woman is trying to stop this from getting out that she treats people this way.

495
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:06,180
 And calling a woman a pig is a fairly common insult, especially between women.

496
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:11,940
 But when we look at the quote of Bill, she has a cigarette behind her ear.

497
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,420
 She's walking down the stairs and Bill says, "I don't like when you have a cigarette behind

498
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,420
 your ear."

499
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,820
 It makes you look like a pig.

500
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,660
 That doesn't even make sense.

501
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:27,540
 And Bill said, like when they were outside and she told him this dream and she goes,

502
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,020
 "And then you called me a pig and I just lost it and fell down the stairs."

503
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:34,540
 Bill goes, "I don't even know why I said that.

504
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:41,740
 I've never said anything like that before and it was the first thing that popped in

505
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,740
 my head.

506
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,740
 I almost didn't.

507
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,260
 It just, I just said it.

508
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,660
 I didn't even think about it.

509
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,260
 I just said it.

510
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:56,820
 And it's interesting because it doesn't make sense at all.

511
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:00,820
 There's never, I mean, unless I'm missing something, unless I know I'm not a farmer, but unless

512
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:04,860
 I'm missing the fact that pigs walk around with cigarettes behind their ears, it doesn't

513
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,860
 make sense.

514
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,260
 I mean, he goes, "I don't know why I said it just popped in my head and it came out of

515
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,260
 my mouth."

516
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:14,420
 That's super interesting because basically what we're doing in a way is recreating the

517
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,580
 crime when Tracy came back to this house.

518
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:22,660
 Who knows how many lives later, this could have been her second or she could have lived,

519
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,340
 you know, 20, 30 different lives.

520
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,340
 Who knows?

521
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,020
 Like reincarnation is one of those things I'm not completely sold on, but I don't completely

522
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,420
 dismiss either.

523
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:37,540
 But she's back in this house and she has a cigarette behind her ear and he says that

524
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,940
 and it doesn't make any sense.

525
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:44,820
 And it is almost like that psychic violence has spread across the decades.

526
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:50,300
 With that, when all of these things, when all of these pieces were back in order, he

527
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,140
 said what she said.

528
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,460
 He said what the old matron said.

529
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,500
 And instead of pushing her, it was just too much and basically like it knocked her down

530
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,340
 the stairs.

531
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:05,940
 Like a psionic blast, like something just erupted.

532
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,940
 It's fascinating.

533
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,340
 It's a super fascinating story.

534
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:13,840
 The daughter, you know, she's the one who's typing this out, but she went on to say that

535
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,900
 Tracy and Bill, my parents, never went back to that house.

536
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,060
 They never went back to that house.

537
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,700
 They still remained friends with Mary.

538
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,780
 I don't know if how many friendships end because someone lives in a haunted house.

539
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,340
 Well, it's not a haunted house actually.

540
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:32,140
 It was really only haunted for Tracy and her horrific memory.

541
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,700
 She goes, they never went back to the house.

542
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,380
 They still remained friends with Mary.

543
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,300
 They never went back.

544
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:44,860
 But Mary continued to live in that house, happily married and then less happily married and

545
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,540
 then eventually things ended in a divorce.

546
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,740
 She was with her husband for about 10 years.

547
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:59,100
 They lived in that house and then she left him and shortly after that, her ex-husband

548
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:07,820
 killed himself in that very house.

549
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,620
 So is the how, I mean, you imagine how you imagine if any place is going to be haunted.

550
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:15,540
 It's a place with a bunch of dead orphans and possibly a murder as well.

551
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:21,060
 It would be interesting that now that Tracy knew the house existed.

552
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:28,620
 Could she have gone back and found paper work or found proof of like a social worker being

553
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,540
 pushed down the stairs, maybe dying at that house?

554
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,860
 Remember, she always woke up right when she was pushed.

555
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,060
 So she could have just fallen down a couple of stairs and then said, I'm still reporting

556
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,300
 you that shove of a few stairs will not stop me.

557
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:45,060
 She reported her and then the orphanage got shut down.

558
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:49,140
 It's possible that she fell all the way down the stairs and died.

559
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:53,460
 It's possible that the orphanage that she complained about the orphanage, but the city didn't do

560
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,500
 anything because the city's like, where else are we going to put these orphans?

561
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,740
 And it continued to operate into the 1950s.

562
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,340
 It's possible that she did report it and they shut it down within a week.

563
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,380
 We don't know.

564
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,820
 We don't know the city where any of this took place.

565
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,820
 Tracy could check this stuff out herself.

566
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,300
 Well we're going to wrap it up like this.

567
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,060
 Would you want to know?

568
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:20,820
 On the one hand, we are paranormal researchers or aficionados of the world of the paranormal

569
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,100
 if you're listening to this podcast.

570
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,420
 So you go, yeah, sure, I would totally want to know if that happened to me.

571
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,900
 If I found out that my reoccurring dream was based on a real life action and may have shown

572
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,700
 that I died in the past life, I'd want to know.

573
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:44,340
 And I think that's easy for us to say, not being the one shoved down the stairs.

574
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:49,340
 But let's put ourselves in Tracy's shoes here for a moment.

575
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,620
 Think of it like this.

576
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,660
 You now know your dreams real.

577
00:35:53,660 --> 00:36:01,220
 You find out the name of the social worker who was pushed down the stairs and died.

578
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:08,380
 And it says in the article, like she was survived by her four children.

579
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,260
 And it gives their names as well.

580
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:17,220
 And would you look those kids up?

581
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,220
 You know what I mean?

582
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:24,540
 If you saw, if you had proof that you died in the past life, as recent as the early 1900s,

583
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,060
 there would still be a bloodline for that family.

584
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,740
 Let's say she had four kids.

585
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,700
 That's a little high for the four kids and a social worker.

586
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,740
 But maybe, you know, the times are different back then.

587
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,420
 She has four kids.

588
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,340
 And then you find out that they all lived, you know, for 1930.

589
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,580
 They may still even be alive.

590
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:45,660
 They may be old people, but then they have families and you have all of these kids and

591
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:52,380
 grandkids of a past life you living in your town.

592
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:59,060
 And then it's really bizarre to think about and it almost may be better not to know than

593
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:03,540
 to find out that you were the mother of a girl named Daisy Adams.

594
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,020
 She was born in 1915.

595
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,700
 She lived to 1975.

596
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:11,180
 She had four kids of her own.

597
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,180
 And they're still alive.

598
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,140
 One of them runs a real estate division.

599
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,660
 One of them played a little bit of college football and then settled down.

600
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,820
 You'd be like, I have a family.

601
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:29,100
 My past life had a life and had all of these kids and all of these relationships and they're

602
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:34,020
 still living in my city and I can look them up in the phone book.

603
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,460
 What do you do in that situation?

604
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:44,660
 Like the past life, it's almost too close to Tracy's modern life.

605
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,660
 You know what I mean?

606
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,820
 Like it's one thing to say, oh, I used to be an Egyptian princess.

607
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,460
 There's another thing to say.

608
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:57,180
 I used to be a plumber in the town that I live in now and he died 50 years ago and he

609
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,180
 had a family.

610
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,820
 So you would have to, it's super trippy.

611
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:07,900
 I think as an abstract guy removed from the situation, I would totally be like, oh, I

612
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,620
 wish the person who wrote this out had told us what city it took place in.

613
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,580
 Maybe we could do a little bit of digging and find out more about this orphanage.

614
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,580
 But I also understand why you wouldn't want to reveal any of that information.

615
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:27,420
 On the flip side, I also realize why you personally, if it happened to you, you wouldn't want to

616
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,900
 investigate it.

617
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:35,220
 So one thing to find out you were related to some surf, not related.

618
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,420
 In a past life, you were a surf in medieval England.

619
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,420
 That's one thing.

620
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:44,700
 It's another thing to find out like your previous life died 10 years before you were

621
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,340
 born.

622
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,620
 And you know 100% like you know how they died.

623
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:55,340
 It was in this day and you can find that person's death on that date in your local newspaper.

624
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:59,500
 That, you know, and it's funny now that I think about it, we don't know how close Mary

625
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,380
 and Bill and Tracy all lived together.

626
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:07,300
 It was close enough that you could travel there to reincarnate in this, in such a short

627
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,860
 time period in the same roughly geographical location.

628
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,980
 It doesn't necessarily say they live in the same city.

629
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:18,380
 But it's close enough to visit.

630
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,380
 It's all, it's weird.

631
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,060
 It's the whole story super weird.

632
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,620
 And then the idea of the same word being used calling them a pig.

633
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:31,260
 Like for a moment was the husband possessed by this old lady?

634
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:37,180
 Or was it just such an intense moment in time that it may play out multiple times.

635
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,580
 That's another, we'll have to wrap it up like this.

636
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,940
 It doesn't keep going on, but when Tracy does inevitably pass away, what are the chances

637
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:49,500
 are that when she does, if reincarnation is true, if she does reincarnate, this won't

638
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,700
 play out again.

639
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,860
 Somehow even that future version of Tracy will somehow be brought into that house.

640
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,060
 That super weird, it's weirder than weirder than I think about it.

641
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:03,900
 Like her friend, who's a close enough friend that they're going to visit each other, buys

642
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,100
 the house that Tracy died in.

643
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,180
 Like there's a lot of little pieces that have to fall into place really Jason.

644
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,020
 Yes, because the story is made up.

645
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,260
 You could argue that obviously in all of this stuff can be made up.

646
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,860
 Every single thing we talk about can be made up.

647
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:22,140
 But if it's not made up, it's actually quite intricate.

648
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,060
 And sugar, I love this story.

649
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,700
 It's really, really cool.

650
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,420
 Did she actually dream of a past life and she had it multiple times?

651
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,340
 Why did the dream stop?

652
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,820
 Why did the fates lead Tracy back there?

653
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,580
 Why did her husband call her a pig?

654
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,260
 Why were the cots still there?

655
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:47,300
 You think you would throw them away, but was part of this whole intricate scheme to have

656
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:51,100
 her know 100% that this was the place?

657
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:57,060
 Was the other husband, the ex-husband suicide caused by dark spirits in this house?

658
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:03,900
 And more chilling of all is will Tracy relive this in one way or the other in other future

659
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,540
 lives?

660
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:13,220
 No matter where she goes or what she does, in future incarnations will she always be

661
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:18,660
 brought back to this house in one way or the other?

662
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:25,940
 Is it possible that this ex-orphanage wasn't just a prison for sick children, but it's

663
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:30,300
 now also become a prison for Tracy herself?

664
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:38,140
 Is it possible that no matter how many times she lives and dies, every incarnation of her

665
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:42,620
 will find its way back into the orphanage?

666
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:51,700
 No matter what she does, no matter who or when she is, she will always find herself standing

667
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,780
 on those stairs.

668
00:41:54,780 --> 00:42:20,580
 Next another prisoner of the orphanage.

669
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:44,180
 Thanks for watching guys!

670
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:54,180
