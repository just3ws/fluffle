1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
 is one of the biggest sci-fi authors in the world.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,000
 The godfather of the Sri Lankan child sex trade?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,160
 I don't know if that's a sentence I would say either, but you heard it.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:20,000
 Then we immediately get whiplash as we change topics to talk about a delightful little conspiracy

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,480
 involving Rudolph the Red-Nosed Rangder.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,560
 And then we end this episode by pulling out our phones and journeying into the world of TikTok.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:37,600
 Is it possible that TikTok is actually the gateway to our eternal tournament today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:48,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,800
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,240
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,840
 I'm having a great day mentally.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,080
 Um, I'm super sick.

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,920
 I mentioned it on yesterday's episode that I wasn't feeling good.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,040
 Now I'm sticky.

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,360
 And it's one of those sicknesses when you wake up from a nap.

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,120
 One of those sicknesses that causes you to nap.

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,400
 And then when you wake up from the nap, you like stink.

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,120
 Like it's coming out of my pores.

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,360
 So if you're a doctor and you're a doctor and you know what that is, hit me up.

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,320
 I don't know what, I'm on a really, really strong antibiotics.

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,160
 So that could be doing it.

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,520
 I could also just be sick, but I feel gross and I'm super sticky.

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,280
 So join me, join me for the next 40 minutes in this tiny closet.

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,280
 As I tell you spooky stories as I'm feeling quite miserable.

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,280
 But one person who always cheers me up, I consider them my personal robotess.

26
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,440
 And coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our newest Patreon supporters.

27
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,840
 Everyone give it up for Moose Fantasy.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,920
 Everyone give a big round of applause to Moose.

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,200
 Moose, Moose, Moose, Moose.

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,600
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,800
 You guys can't throw away the Patreon.

32
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,840
 I totally understand.

33
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,520
 Just help spread the word about the show.

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,760
 Really, really helps out a lot.

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,080
 I also have, I don't know why I'm shilling this all of a sudden,

36
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,520
 but I have my Amazon wish list.

37
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,360
 And then speaking of gifts, I got a curious item today in my PO box.

38
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,400
 I don't know who sent it to me.

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,440
 There was no note.

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,040
 Something called, I'm wondering if it's an ARG or a board game.

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,200
 Or basically some sort of Jumanji-esque trap that I'm going to start playing and fall into.

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,720
 It's called McSweeney's 64, the audio issue.

43
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,560
 And you open it up and it's a box with materials.

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,480
 I can tell the box materials cost more than most of the stuff in my apartment.

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,360
 This isn't an ad.

46
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,880
 I don't know what it is.

47
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,680
 I don't know what it is.

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,920
 If it's an ad, I don't know what it is.

49
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,720
 I opened it up and it's like there's a scroll and a booklet,

50
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,800
 a big old keychain from McSweeney's.

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,960
 So thanks for whoever sent it.

52
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,760
 I'm sure it's this whimsical fun adventure,

53
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,600
 but I don't know even know where to start.

54
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,360
 Probably reading the instructions.

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
 I think there's instructions in there.

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,040
 But whoever sent me the McSweeney's package,

57
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,920
 thank you very much.

58
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,400
 If I get sucked into an audio world where I outrun musical alligators and hippos made of tubas,

59
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,200
 then then you guys know where I went.

60
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
 I got sucked into the world of McSweeney's.

61
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,520
 I'm not for sure what it is, but I'm sure it'll be fun.

62
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,240
 Moose Fantasy, let's go ahead and Tosh shoot.

63
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,880
 So thank you for that.

64
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,360
 Moose Fantasy, let's go ahead and Tosh shoot the keys to the

65
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,600
 Dead Rabbit Durgible.

66
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

67
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,880
 We're headed all the way out to Sri Lanka.

68
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,480
 And before we get started on this story,

69
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,840
 I wanted to give a shout out to a writer known as Jason Sanford.

70
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,440
 Jason is an author and they wrote this right up on their Patreon page.

71
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,800
 They made it available to the public.

72
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,240
 And what an investigation it was, Jason.

73
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,320
 None of this would be possible without your research.

74
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,360
 So I wanted to give you a shout out.

75
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,920
 Thank you very much.

76
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,480
 In the full article, we'll be in the show notes, obviously.

77
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,240
 The year is 1998 and we're in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

78
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,800
 And we're walking down the street and there's a bunch of like kids flying kites

79
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,960
 and there's like a cat sitting on a wall.

80
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,920
 And we see a kindly old man standing outside the house

81
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,960
 and he's kind of waving to us.

82
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,040
 He's like, "Hey guys, how are you doing?"

83
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,800
 We're like, "Hey, dude, you look like you live here."

84
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,240
 And he's like, "Yes, obviously I'm standing outside of my house, you nitwits."

85
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,080
 Then he apologizes for calling us nitwits.

86
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:25,040
 And he goes to shake our hands and he goes, "My name is Clark, Arthur C. Clark."

87
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,920
 And you're like, "Whoa, dude, this is like my favorite sci-fi author ever."

88
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,200
 And you're like shaking his hand.

89
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,240
 You're getting all close to him.

90
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,680
 You're like standing right next to him.

91
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,200
 You're like, "Can I rub my shoulders against you?"

92
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,640
 He's like, "Anything for you."

93
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,640
 And I'm all, "Ew, you don't know how this story goes yet."

94
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,600
 Gross.

95
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,360
 And you don't understand why I'm so grossed out.

96
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,480
 And I kind of grab you by the shoulder

97
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,080
 and we're walking on the streets of Colombo.

98
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,040
 And I was like, "Dude, yeah, I know that's Arthur C. Clark.

99
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,960
 He's a world-famous science fiction author.

100
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,600
 He wrote 2001, A Space Odyssey.

101
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,400
 He wrote 2010, Rendezvous with Rama.

102
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,040
 These are all classics of the sci-fi literature.

103
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,680
 And even if you aren't into sci-fi,

104
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,520
 if you're into the world of the paranormal,

105
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:09,040
 he actually was one of the big pushers of paranormal phenomenon in the '70s and the '80s.

106
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,480
 He had like his own book series.

107
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,320
 I think he actually had his own television series called

108
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,720
 "Mistories of the World" by Arthur C. Clark.

109
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,880
 He's written a lot about the paranormal world,

110
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,200
 but over time he became more skeptical.

111
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,160
 He loves the paranormal, but it kept letting him down so much he became a skeptic.

112
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,960
 He goes, "You just can't prove any of this."

113
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,400
 Now, Arthur C. Clark, I didn't know this until I was doing this reading,

114
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,960
 and this has been verified over and over again.

115
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,520
 But Arthur C. Clark, he was a huge science fiction writer in the '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s.

116
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,440
 He's passed away now, but he was also gay.

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,960
 Now, back in the '80s, the '70s, the '60s, that was a career killer.

118
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,680
 Really, I'd say even in the '90s, that was a career killer.

119
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,880
 If someone found out that you were homosexual and you were doing any sort of job, right,

120
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,720
 you could probably lose your job.

121
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,040
 So that was kept under wraps.

122
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,240
 That was kept under wraps, but people high up in the publishing business,

123
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,920
 other authors knew that he was gay.

124
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,880
 So when he moved to Sri Lanka back in 1956,

125
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,640
 it wasn't even called Sri Lanka back then when he moved there,

126
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,000
 people go, "Oh, he's going there because that way he can live his lifestyle.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,560
 It doesn't need to be in the proverbial closet anymore.

128
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,440
 He can live his lifestyle in this country that's more accepting towards that."

129
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,240
 So whatever.

130
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,520
 He can still write the books, will still publish them, and people kind of kept his secret.

131
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,000
 But in 1998 is where we're at.

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,640
 He's about to be knighted by Prince Charles.

133
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,680
 And at this point, Arthur C. Clark, it has polio.

134
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,240
 Apparently this was still going around.

135
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,600
 He got a really bad case of polio back in '83, so he uses a wheelchair or crutches or a cane

136
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,480
 to move about, depending on the circumstance, which we will soon quickly find that he has to

137
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,400
 figure out different ways to chase people around.

138
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,480
 But he can't leave the country, basically.

139
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,160
 So this is how high level.

140
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,880
 If this is the first time you're really knowing about Arthur C. Clark,

141
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,320
 you're from a different generation, you might have heard of 2001, the movie.

142
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:11,120
 This guy is such a big deal that Prince Charles was going to fly to Sri Lanka to knight Arthur C.

143
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,440
 Clark.

144
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,880
 And one of the things that he's credited for is he's also a futurist.

145
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,920
 So he was very, very early talking about satellites being the next big thing.

146
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,880
 He kept saying, "Guys, we're going to start putting these satellites in orbit,

147
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,840
 and that's going to allow us to communicate across the globe.

148
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,520
 This is going to leave behind all other sorts of communication.

149
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,680
 Phones and telegraphs and pigeons, carrier pigeons.

150
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,040
 We're going to go straight to the satellite."

151
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,560
 And that ended up becoming true.

152
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,880
 And it's interesting because Rupert Murdoch is a close friend of Arthur C. Clark.

153
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,000
 And one of the reasons why they became such friends was Rupert Murdoch heard Arthur C.

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,040
 Clark's predictions about satellites invested heavily in satellites and satellite television

155
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,640
 and made a mint.

156
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:03,280
 So in a way, Rupert Murdoch owed his fortune, or at least a portion of his fortune,

157
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,400
 to Arthur C. Clark.

158
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,160
 So this was a big level, guys.

159
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,760
 So the fact that Prince Charles was coming out to see him and not being like,

160
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,560
 "If you want to be knighted, you better get that wheelchair on a boat, buddy."

161
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,000
 He goes out here.

162
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,560
 It's a big deal.

163
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:22,240
 The Daily Mirror, a newspaper in Britain, though, before Arthur C. Clark can be knighted,

164
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,200
 they run an article about Arthur C. Clark.

165
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,400
 Now, it's not a glowing article.

166
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,400
 It's not a roundup of all the books he's written or why he doesn't believe in ghosts so much anymore.

167
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,720
 It's more of an article that includes quotes like this.

168
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,160
 This guy's about to be knighted.

169
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,200
 This is one of the quotes from this article.

170
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,520
 Quote, "But Clark's fading health does not stop him from enjoying his favorite pastime.

171
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:56,800
 Playing table tennis with schoolboys at a notorious pickup haunt for perverts

172
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,160
 called the Otters Aquatic Club."

173
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,200
 They out now call him a pedophile in this article.

174
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
 Now, the Daily Mail is a tabloid.

175
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,120
 They're all tabloids.

176
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,080
 Over there, I don't know how the British get any real news.

177
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,240
 That you have the sun and the mirror and news of the day and the Daily Mirror and all these tabloids.

178
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,240
 And so they're running this and people are like,

179
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,720
 "Well, again, this is British newspaper and it's a tabloid,

180
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,840
 but let's see what other information they have to back up before they get sued into oblivion."

181
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
 All these other quotes start coming out of this article.

182
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,080
 And what the Daily Mirror says is we sent two reporters down there and we didn't tell Arthur

183
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,360
 that they were reporters.

184
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,720
 It was just two dudes walking around hanging out with Arthur C. Clark pretending to be his buddy.

185
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,640
 Let's look at some of these other quotes because that's a pretty bold claim, right?

186
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,680
 Here's another one.

187
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,880
 He was called by these two reporters.

188
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,840
 I don't know who these reporters pretended to be fellow perverts.

189
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,120
 I'm assuming because he was called by these reporters.

190
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,120
 One of the founders of the child sex tourism in Sri Lanka.

191
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,960
 And that's the reason why he moved out there was the access to boys and he actually caused other

192
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:14,960
 men to fly out to Sri Lanka to indulge in this disgusting act in Sri Lanka away from Prineyes.

193
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,320
 Or at least if the Prineyes see them, they're easily bribed.

194
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,560
 When he's asked about stopping the child sex trade, because these reporters are

195
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,800
 having this apparently casual conversation with a pervert, this is what you talk about,

196
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,040
 when he says that he wants to stop the child sex trade,

197
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,080
 quote, but how do we stop it?

198
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,560
 This is an actual quote from Arthur C. Clark, your favorite author, quote,

199
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,400
 but how do we stop it without interfering with the rights of responsible adults?

200
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,960
 That's always the big concern, right?

201
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,600
 Whenever you see child trafficking, you're like, hey, we could really crack down on this.

202
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,160
 But you know, anyways, just crack down on it.

203
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,440
 Don't worry about these guys.

204
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,960
 Anyways, and then we have quotes like this, quote,

205
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,520
 I have never had the slightest interest in children.

206
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,600
 You're like, oh, that's pretty cut in your eye, buddy.

207
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,160
 That's quick.

208
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,680
 Why you keep calling this guy pedophile?

209
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,400
 You don't have any proof.

210
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,960
 The proof is the rest of the sentence, my friends.

211
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,520
 Quote, I have never had the slightest interest in children, boys or girls.

212
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,320
 They should be treated in the same way.

213
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,520
 But this is not a sentence you ever want to add a but to.

214
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:33,760
 But once they have reached the age of puberty, then it is okay.

215
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,080
 And then it's not just to reiterate, that it's not to be saying that.

216
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,520
 That is esteemed science fiction author Arthur C. Clark.

217
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,120
 So what is that?

218
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,600
 Eleven?

219
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,760
 Right?

220
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,280
 That's insane, dude.

221
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,520
 This isn't some farming community in 1700s France.

222
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,560
 And even then, even then I don't recommend it.

223
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,920
 But like my great grandma was 12 when she started having babies because they owned a farm.

224
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,840
 So you start having kids early, early on, but this,

225
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,480
 this high boy doesn't own a farm too.

226
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,520
 He's not having kids.

227
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,480
 Three, it's the 80s or at least the 50s since he's been doing this stuff.

228
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,600
 Anyways, and then probably the worst quote.

229
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,880
 Oh, I'm sorry guys.

230
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,240
 You're like, oh man, this is a real festive.

231
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,800
 Don't worry.

232
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,280
 There's a Rudolph story after this if you're still around.

233
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,360
 Quote, and this is a pretty standard pedophile quote.

234
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,160
 If you, if the other ones you're like, ah, maybe, maybe,

235
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,800
 maybe the other ones are maybe then whatever.

236
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,920
 But here's the one that really is the nail in the coffin quote.

237
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,000
 I think most of the damage, and I've heard this from other pedophiles,

238
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,840
 not, not ones that I've originally hang out with,

239
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,080
 but reading news articles and stuff like that from people who engage in this activity.

240
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,120
 Quote, I think most of the damage comes from the fuss

241
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,640
 made by hysterical parents afterwards.

242
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,760
 If the kids don't mind, I hate to say this stuff, right?

243
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,080
 Because it's basically my voice saying this.

244
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,640
 Someone's going to clip it and make something horrible happen.

245
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,120
 If the kids don't mind, Arthur C. Clark said, fair enough.

246
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,880
 Unquote.

247
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,840
 He goes on and he says, yeah, I hang out at this place called the Otters Aquatic Club.

248
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,240
 He, he has sex with kids as young as 12,

249
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,000
 and he pays them 10 to 15 pounds for this.

250
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,840
 And the article goes on.

251
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,480
 It tracks down some of these young men who are now in their 30s,

252
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,280
 and they're like, yeah, we used to go there and all the old men would pay us money

253
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,000
 and it was super gross.

254
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,040
 We don't want to do it.

255
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,960
 But we could feed our family for like a week.

256
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,680
 So we did it.

257
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,200
 And they, this is a full on investigation.

258
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,600
 And a bunch of everything's happened at once.

259
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,560
 The Daily Mirror publishes this article and Prince Charles goes,

260
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,000
 uh, you know that whole, you know that whole nighting thing.

261
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,120
 We'll do that later.

262
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,720
 Let's see how this plays out.

263
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,280
 I don't know.

264
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,720
 I'm surprised I've never heard of this.

265
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,800
 This is all happening in the late 90s.

266
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,200
 But apparently it was bigger news over in England.

267
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,520
 They stopped the nighting process.

268
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,080
 He was just, the sword was just touching one shoulder.

269
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,360
 And they're like, stop it, stop it.

270
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,560
 Don't make them a night.

271
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,840
 They stopped the nighting process.

272
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
 Prince Charles never even goes over there.

273
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,480
 But people are having a really hard time wrapping their heads around this.

274
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,840
 And one of the people who's having a super hard time wrapping his head around it

275
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,520
 is Rupert Murdoch.

276
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,960
 So again, I told you that he invested a bunch of his money in satellites.

277
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,560
 I did leave out one detail.

278
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,880
 He owns several British newspapers.

279
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,760
 Rupert Murdoch, he owns Fox News today.

280
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,680
 He's a newspaper magnate.

281
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,840
 He's a media guy who just buys a bunch of media like Ted Turner and things like that.

282
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,720
 So he's furious because this is one of his really good friends

283
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,080
 and someone he owes a lot to.

284
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,000
 And he starts making phone calls saying,

285
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,680
 I'm going to find out who those reporters are.

286
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,960
 Well, they knew who the reporters were.

287
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,480
 He could just have to read the byline.

288
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,320
 But he goes, those reporters are never going to work in British journalism again.

289
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,840
 Like I'm shutting them down because this is 100% not true.

290
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,680
 What happens is the Daily Mirror ends up running an apology for the article.

291
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,800
 But they do not run a retraction.

292
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,320
 They say we're sorry for your policy in this.

293
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,080
 But they do not say that none of it is true.

294
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,840
 But the Sri Lankan authorities obviously have a bunch of egg on their face

295
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,080
 because it was basically like this is something that Westerners just do

296
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,280
 to come have sex with these boys and the police aren't doing anything about it.

297
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,000
 So the Sri Lankan police started investigating and they say we didn't come back with anything.

298
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,560
 We did not come back with any evidence from hanging out at the Otter Aquatic Club.

299
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
 Just the name.

300
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,960
 Just the name is the evidence guys, right?

301
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,920
 Anyways, the Sri Lankan authorities say they don't have any evidence.

302
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,680
 Interpol went to the Daily Mirror and said,

303
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,800
 well, if this is true, we want a recording because we know your reporters recorded this

304
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,680
 conversation.

305
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,400
 We want that.

306
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,560
 Interpol wants the recording so they can open an investigation in Arthur C. Clark.

307
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,200
 And the reporters refused to give the recordings over to Interpol.

308
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,440
 So at this point, Interpol goes, it's not real.

309
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,120
 Sri Lankan authorities go, it's not real.

310
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,000
 The public goes, well, how come you're not giving the recording up to Interpol?

311
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,800
 Maybe it's not real.

312
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,560
 Rupert Murdoch still storming around.

313
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:09,440
 Eventually Prince Charles did fly out to Sri Lanka and knighted Arthur C. Clark.

314
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,040
 Arthur C. Clark dies in 2008.

315
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,680
 And a curious thing happened when he passed away.

316
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,520
 He's an official knight of the realm.

317
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:28,240
 When he passed away, the British crown, the British royal institution, gave no statement on his death.

318
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,040
 Hey, it's really sad to see one of our knights missing.

319
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,120
 If we ever get invaded by the French again, we're one soldier down.

320
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,360
 But they didn't say anything.

321
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,080
 But again, people didn't really think.

322
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,200
 Much of it, the whole idea of him possibly being a pedophile had disappeared.

323
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,800
 It had been 10 years since then.

324
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,080
 So a curious tale, right?

325
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,760
 Is there any truth behind this?

326
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,480
 Well, we get a little more information a couple years later.

327
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:01,840
 Before the Daily Mirror ran this article, they heard that another newspaper was trying to investigate Arthur C. Clark.

328
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,880
 It was not, this kind of fell into their laps.

329
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
 There was a newspaper called News of the World

330
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,040
 that was going to run an article about Arthur C. Clark being a pedophile.

331
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,040
 And as they were putting it together, the editors said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

332
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:41,040
 And as they were putting it together, the editors said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

333
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:58,160
 And what happened was the Daily Mirror heard what happened at News of the World and they go, "Oh, let's run with it instead."

334
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,200
 Which I'm now realizing is the bulk of this episode.

335
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,440
 I didn't think the story was going to take so long to tell.

336
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,200
 But I find it fascinating.

337
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,120
 I find it absolutely fascinating.

338
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,360
 Because we constantly see these powerful people.

339
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,040
 I shouldn't say constantly, but it does happen more than you want.

340
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,800
 These powerful people involved.

341
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,400
 This isn't just Arthur C. Clark as a pedophile, which is bad enough.

342
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,920
 This is him actively partaking in the child trafficking thing.

343
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,760
 Like, that's where it becomes industrialized.

344
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,120
 You know what I mean?

345
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,920
 Like, it's worse.

346
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,240
 I'm not saying that, I'm not saying it's okay to be the first one, but it's worse.

347
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,160
 You've basically industrialized it.

348
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,440
 And you just start to think, you know, I understand why the conspiracy theories of this

349
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,280
 worldwide pedophile cabal stick, because we keep seeing this.

350
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,920
 Have you guys been seeing what's going on with that CNN producer?

351
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,880
 I don't have his names.

352
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,720
 This is just off the top of my head, but that CNN producer, I know he used to work for Chris Cuomo.

353
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,000
 He got caught with child trafficking.

354
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,320
 He got caught like, I'll put it in the show notes.

355
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:09,040
 He got arrested the other day for hooking up with women on social apps and having them

356
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,120
 bring their nine-year-old daughter out to his house, which that's awful.

357
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,440
 And that's child exploitation and child trafficking.

358
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,160
 But then what we're starting to see, because now his life is becoming public,

359
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,880
 and the police are investigating this and they're going to his house and they're

360
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,920
 searching their all stuff and the detectives are looking at each other and they go,

361
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,040
 he shouldn't be able to afford any of this.

362
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,000
 Like this is millions of dollars worth of real estate and millions of dollars worth of automobiles.

363
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,640
 And sure, he works at CNN, but that's like what, the lowest-rated news service?

364
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,760
 How much does he really make?

365
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,320
 Not enough for that stuff.

366
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,680
 So is he, was he engaged in child trafficking and super lucrative business?

367
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,040
 Because you have something that is very, very hard to get and something people will pay any

368
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,680
 amount for.

369
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,320
 There's also banned suggestions.

370
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,000
 This is actually, I read this in like gossipy, more gossipy places, but that

371
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,440
 there was four other men present that night when that woman brought the nine-year-old out to his

372
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:07,680
 house.

373
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,200
 So who were the four other men, right?

374
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,320
 Are these other high-profile people, rich people?

375
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,360
 Is he, who knows?

376
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,680
 They're also, it's odd.

377
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,640
 It seems to be the one thing, it seems to be the one thing everyone hates,

378
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,960
 but it seems to be the hardest thing to be canceled over.

379
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,440
 Because when we look at Woody Allen, who got charged with it, he's still making movies.

380
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,680
 Roman Polanski got charged with it.

381
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,880
 He was still making movies.

382
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,280
 You, you have, there was that one guy who was, I don't want to talk about pedophiles for the whole

383
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,880
 half hour, 40 minutes or whatever he did.

384
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,320
 There was the one famous case, it's so famous, I don't remember the guy's name though,

385
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,880
 I'll try to put it in the show notes, but he was a

386
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,600
 on-set teacher in Hollywood and he'd been charged and convicted of child molestation.

387
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,280
 And after he got out of jail, they hired him back.

388
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,840
 And he just went back to teaching kids in Hollywood because they're like, he's a really good teacher.

389
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,720
 So it's almost like the one thing that you should instantly get your ass kicked over,

390
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,840
 but it's also the thing that you don't get canceled over.

391
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,080
 You know, it's just gross.

392
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,640
 It's just gross.

393
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,680
 I try to spend a small amount of time possible.

394
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:14,480
 I try to give a tiny amount of possible of brain power to thinking about pedophiles and their disgusting acts.

395
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,000
 But then I do a true crime podcast and I get, I see articles about it all the time.

396
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,960
 I really don't even try to, I try to pretend that it doesn't exist,

397
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,160
 if I got to be honest with you guys, it's so absolutely disgusting to me.

398
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,000
 But when it does pop up and when it's someone this high profile, it's just super bizarre.

399
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,240
 I spent longer than I wanted to talking about that, but we're just going to keep going.

400
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,600
 We're going to save the route off.

401
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,880
 Oh, we'll do, we'll do the whole thing.

402
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,560
 We'll just have a long episode.

403
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,200
 Moose Fantasy, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught,

404
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,920
 our battleship.

405
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
 Let's take it out of mothball status.

406
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,040
 I haven't used it in a while.

407
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,440
 We're leaving behind Sri Lanka, thankfully.

408
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,400
 We are headed all the way up to the North Pole.

409
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,400
 Bum, bum, big battleship.

410
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,760
 I'm going to check in as a horn.

411
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,320
 I don't think battleships have the Carnival Cruise Line horn.

412
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,960
 Moose Fantasy has taken us all the way up to the North Pole.

413
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,520
 And we should have brought our jackets.

414
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,160
 It's super cold.

415
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,040
 We're seeing little elves.

416
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,480
 I'm just speeding through this one.

417
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,160
 I'm going to do this one in record time.

418
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,360
 A bunch of little elves walking around.

419
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,800
 No, no, I'm going to take my time with this.

420
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,080
 It's a really cool one.

421
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,080
 December 6th, 1964.

422
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,360
 We're in the North Pole and we're watching the very first showing of Rudolph the Red

423
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,000
 Nosed Reindeer.

424
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,600
 And we're watching it with all of the actors.

425
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,280
 We're watching it with Hermie, the little elf dude.

426
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,720
 He's like, I want to be a dentist.

427
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,000
 And then there's Yukon Cornelius, who's like, me.

428
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,720
 Whatever I do, whatever my gimmick is.

429
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,040
 And he has his pickaxe and he's licking his pickaxe.

430
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,840
 We're like, huh?

431
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,440
 And then they have the bumbles there.

432
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,360
 The big giant monster is like, oh, yeah.

433
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,000
 And a bunch of broken toys.

434
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,880
 I brought those.

435
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,680
 I brought those.

436
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,640
 Maybe I was hoping I could sell them to elves and make some elf cash.

437
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,880
 But we watch, we've all seen the movie of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, I believe.

438
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,840
 It's one of my favorite, the little asterix.

439
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,000
 That was one of my favorite when I was six.

440
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,080
 Like nowadays, I don't really know how well it holds up, but I really loved it.

441
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,800
 I really loved it.

442
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,320
 I thought that female deer was kind of,

443
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,720
 the female deer was kind of cute, honestly.

444
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,520
 Hey, Rudolph.

445
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,720
 How I, how I didn't become a furry.

446
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,600
 I have no idea.

447
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,960
 But anyways, I didn't.

448
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,200
 I didn't think she was cute.

449
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,680
 And so we all have seen Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.

450
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,160
 It's a great story about, don't let your differences hold you back.

451
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,040
 And don't let what other people will say about you hold you back as well.

452
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,560
 It's a great message for kids, right?

453
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,040
 And it's a huge hit.

454
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,000
 It was a huge hit.

455
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,480
 But when the first time they showed it on December 6th, 1964, it was different.

456
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,360
 It was not the version you see today.

457
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,720
 The original ending, everything else plays out pretty much the same.

458
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,160
 But at the ending, Rudolph is like, oh, you mean I get to command the sleigh?

459
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,240
 And Santa's like, whoa, slow down.

460
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,000
 Command is a pretty strong word.

461
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,960
 You're going to lead the sleigh.

462
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,920
 And he's like, oh, that's what I meant.

463
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,880
 And they go floating around the planet.

464
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,760
 And he like, his nose is lighting up so they can make it through the fog.

465
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,800
 And Santa goes, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

466
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,880
 And the credits roll.

467
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,840
 People are like, oh, that was cool.

468
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,880
 Parents are like, what'd you think?

469
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,920
 Kids and the kids are like,

470
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,040
 they didn't like it.

471
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,760
 They didn't like, they liked it all the way up to the last five minutes

472
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,880
 because what's different in our version versus their version

473
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,200
 is they do not return to the island of misfit toys

474
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,880
 to then rescue those toys and give those to the children.

475
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,680
 And the original version, Rudolph goes to the island of misfit toys,

476
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,280
 realizes that all these toys are busted, but they're still fun to play with,

477
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,280
 and then leaves them there.

478
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,920
 And so a lot of, there was a lot of letters being written in to the network saying, hey,

479
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:52,400
 we really liked it, but the ending basically said,

480
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,520
 if you're busted and broken down, no one will ever play with you.

481
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,880
 But maybe if you have some sort of benefit to someone else,

482
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,160
 they'll let you command their, I mean, lead their sleigh.

483
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,280
 So Rankin and Bass said, okay, we have one year to fix this and make this a holiday classic

484
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,400
 because it's near perfect.

485
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,640
 What we're going to do is we're going to add something to the ending

486
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,680
 where they go and they're delivering the misfit toys

487
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,080
 and the little boys and girls who get the jack o lantern,

488
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,240
 we who can't jack or the doll with one eye or whatever,

489
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,920
 they'll love them just the same because these kids are obviously super poor

490
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,160
 and they can't afford nonbroken toys.

491
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,920
 So they went and they added that in.

492
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:34,000
 So the version we see nowadays is this, everyone, everyone has a home,

493
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,080
 everyone has a place, which again is a great message,

494
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,640
 but they have to take something out.

495
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:44,560
 So this is one of those things that I never realized growing up.

496
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,800
 I just really enjoyed the show.

497
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,080
 I hope that lady, dear, I hope that lady Reindeer shows them again.

498
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,240
 What was her name too?

499
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,000
 It's like Sally or Monica or something like that.

500
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,800
 I don't know.

501
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,560
 And Mrs. Carpenter, the point is, is that they had to cut something out.

502
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,800
 Wasn't my fantasy.

503
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,160
 I don't even know why we're going on.

504
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,160
 That's apparently, that's how sick and sticky I am

505
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,520
 is I'm talking about deer sex.

506
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:15,680
 The, the scene they cut out was the whole movie apparently.

507
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,080
 It's been a while since I've seen it because my parole officer won't let me watch it.

508
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,520
 It's been a while since I've seen it, but the whole show apparently Yukon Jacky keeps sticking

509
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,640
 his pickaxe into the ground and then licking it, licking the tip of the pickaxe and go, not yet.

510
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,920
 What is this sticks in the ground later on?

511
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,800
 Oh, maybe, but not yet.

512
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:45,760
 All of this stuff builds up to the ending where Yukon Jack, it turns out to the whole time,

513
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,720
 this will probably blow your mind or you just don't care.

514
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,080
 It'll be one of the two, but apparently the original version of this is Yukon Jack has

515
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,800
 a backstory.

516
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,720
 He's trying to find a peppermint mine.

517
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,040
 The whole time that's his mission.

518
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,080
 The elf wants to be a dentist, Rudolph wants to prove his worth,

519
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,720
 and Yukon Jack wants to find a peppermint mine.

520
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,280
 And every time he puts his pickaxe into the ground, he's testing it for the taste of peppermint.

521
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,200
 What they cut out was there's now an ending scene, or there used to be an ending scene,

522
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,280
 where he goes, "peppermint!

523
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,160
 What I've been waiting for all my life!

524
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,440
 I'm strung at rich!

525
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,360
 I got me a peppermint mine!

526
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,160
 Woo!"

527
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,600
 So it made everything make sense.

528
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,280
 Now it looks like this guy just has some weird fetish that he likes tasting dirt.

529
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:39,280
 So they took out that 30 seconds of explaining his plot, explaining his reason for being,

530
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,240
 and then they put it in, "now what's better really for the kids?"

531
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,320
 It's for them to go out and eat dirt, hoping they'll find peppermint mines,

532
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,280
 or is it that everyone has a place and don't give up even if you're not perfect?

533
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,400
 That's the message.

534
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,720
 But so weird, like when we talk about lost media, there's a little thing that they clipped down,

535
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,040
 and nobody really would have noticed it was missing,

536
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,800
 had it not been for this really real bizarre set of events,

537
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
 where a man keeps licking his pickaxe.

538
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:12,880
 Moose fantasy, get those moose foots going, get us on board the carbonercopter.

539
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,960
 Tosh, you the keys, catch him in your mouth.

540
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,320
 He's like, "Dude, I have hands, it's just a name, I'm not actually a moose."

541
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,920
 Moose fantasy, take your hands and grab these carbonercopter keys.

542
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:29,600
 We are leaving behind the North Pole, we are headed out to your pocket.

543
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:41,680
 And the helicopter rotors like morph into the sound of a vibrating phone in your pocket.

544
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,560
 You're like, "huh, that's weird."

545
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:49,120
 And you pull your phone out, and you look, and it's a new TikTok from me.

546
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,160
 If you don't know, I do have a TikTok at Dead Rabbit Radio, and I'm doing my Fortnite dances

547
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,800
 and stuff like that. You know, I'll tell you this, I'm on YouTube, and there's,

548
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,280
 I love YouTubers, there's one or two that I absolutely can't stand.

549
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:09,760
 And I obviously have a podcast, and I love podcasters, there's maybe, again, maybe one or two,

550
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:16,560
 or five podcasters, I just can't stand. I'm on TikTok, and I hate people on TikTok.

551
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:22,800
 I despise, I don't know what it is. I've never felt such a... I feel like a racist.

552
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:29,680
 I feel like this is how racists must feel. Just the fact that they have this shared commonality

553
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:37,120
 that they're all on TikTok, I want to... they enrage me. I don't know why.

554
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,720
 TikTokers, I mean, I swear I want to beat them each to death with a shovel. It's the weirdest thing.

555
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,800
 TikTokers are some of the most insufferable performers ever. I can't stand them either.

556
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,520
 But there's some good content on there. There's my true crime stuff, and then there's

557
00:29:53,520 --> 00:30:00,160
 Koli. That's about it. Me and Koli. So anyways, you're never gonna go look up Koli and realize

558
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,480
 the other reason why I'm on TikTok. But when I was doing my Thanksgiving livestream,

559
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,920
 I got an interesting comment question from Creole Cosmopolitan, and it was basically,

560
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,720
 "Do you think that TikTok could be gathering information to Blackmail people in the future?"

561
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:21,760
 And I thought, "Wow, what an amazing, interesting conspiracy theory, right?"

562
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,960
 Because again, a good conspiracy theory includes people we don't trust, things we really can't

563
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,200
 verify, and things that sound true. These are all things that go into a good conspiracy theory.

564
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:41,440
 So I appreciate that. That it's been percolating in my head since Thanksgiving is TikTok a Blackmail

565
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,200
 engine. And this would make sense. I'm not accusing them of doing this legally. I'm not saying that

566
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,400
 they're doing this, but think about it this way. Everything we do is recorded. Everything that

567
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,800
 we do, every search engine when we're carrying our phone around, I'll come home and it'll show all

568
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,480
 the places that I was at and ask for me to give reviews on all these restaurants and all this.

569
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,080
 So it's constantly bringing in information, and the idea has always been that these services

570
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,600
 provide us with free service. So like, we get free email, we get free Facebook, we get free Instagram,

571
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,000
 and in return they're selling our information. That's how they're making the bulk of their money.

572
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,960
 And so when TikTok comes onto the scene, you're thinking it's the same deal. And for the most

573
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,280
 part, it is. Now, of course, Gmail and Facebook and Instagram, they have ad components as well,

574
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,920
 but when's the last time you clicked on a Facebook ad? That seems like such an emperor with no

575
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,080
 closed thing. Internet ads, because I never click on them. I don't think most people ever really

576
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,680
 click on internet ads, but for whatever reason, people spend billions of dollars on internet

577
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:47,120
 advertising. So they do make money, but it seems to be the bulk of their money comes from selling

578
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,240
 your information. So what's the next step? Because when TikTok comes out, TikTok is one of those

579
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,320
 platforms that costs a lot of money to process video YouTube. If it wasn't part of the Gmail,

580
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,760
 Google family, they wouldn't exist. It costs too much money to process and host all of that video.

581
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:09,760
 They have to be part of a larger group to help carry the cost over. So when you're looking at

582
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,840
 something like TikTok, how is it possible that they're able to host all of this video footage

583
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,880
 on these servers and be able to spread it that cost must be phenomenal. And of course, they do

584
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:28,240
 sell your information and they do have ads. What I found interesting though about TikTok is 79%

585
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:36,160
 of its revenue comes from China. Over in China, it's called Duyan. And 79% of its revenue comes

586
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:43,200
 from China. America only is 8% of TikTok's revenue. Doesn't even seem like it'd really be worth it.

587
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,880
 To push it out over here, you should just focus on your Chinese audience. But going back to Creole

588
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,840
 Cosmopolitan's conspiracy theory, think about it this way. My phone's constantly recording

589
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,400
 everywhere that I'm at. And then every show, often I'm doing these TikTok videos. I'm dancing the

590
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:06,320
 luce or whatever Fortnite dances most popular nowadays. And then I forget about it and I grow up

591
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:12,080
 and I was a kid. I was a teenager in the original version of me. But now I have a LinkedIn profile

592
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,160
 and I have this Gmail account and you start seeing me posting stuff on this business Instagram account.

593
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,240
 Is it possible, Conspiracy Cat fully on, is it possible that as your internet presence grows,

594
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,920
 there's these algorithms measuring it? And when it sees your name start to pop up in

595
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,600
 political forums, when they start to see your information popped up in high level business

596
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,480
 forums or high level entertainment forums, they're seeing you linked into all these other powerful

597
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:43,520
 people. The algorithm then begins to go through all past activity. Because this information doesn't

598
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:50,560
 go away. And it would be useless on somebody like myself, basically, because the stuff I do on TikTok

599
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:55,600
 or where I'm going through the city of Hood River really wouldn't matter because at the end of the day,

600
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,320
 I just crawl into my haunted closet and tell ghost stories to all of my friends. But if I was a

601
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,440
 powerful politician and I was doing a bunch of goofy stuff and going to some places that would

602
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:12,000
 not be good for my reputation when I was younger, and now I'm in my 20s, my 30s, and I'm running for

603
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,960
 Congress, that algorithm, it gets triggered when you get high enough up and it begins to go through

604
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,440
 everything in the past and pull out every TikTok video, every Snapchat that you thought was deleted,

605
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,120
 every single piece of information that could be embarrassing. And then a dossier is presented to

606
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:36,880
 you and said, Hello, future US Senator, we need to talk. Is that possible? Well, I think we're

607
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,040
 about to find out, right? It's interesting because you listen, my generation, when I was up to some

608
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,520
 salty stuff, I didn't have a tracking device on me at all times and I definitely wasn't posting

609
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:52,480
 about it online. I was doing stuff and then I was like, okay, that's done. I'm gonna go to this

610
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,680
 other location that's much safer and hang out here. But we're gonna, we have a whole, really

611
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:03,440
 every generation going forward from this, they by the age of 6, 11 really at most, they have

612
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,000
 tracking devices on them. And it's I cringe every time I see something I post it on Facebook when

613
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,520
 it pops up in my memories from like 2011, I'm like, who were you, you nerd? Why would you write that?

614
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,200
 Why would you even write that? I get cringey when I'm reading stuff like that. If I was running for

615
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,400
 office and someone starts pulling up old tweets, if you are start posting your internet presence

616
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,080
 when you're 11, when you're nothing but pure unfiltered cringe, there's nothing a kid,

617
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:36,160
 there's nothing a kid can do that does not immediately make me go, oh, cringe, bro.

618
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:44,960
 So imagine having a huge, huge repository of your cringe, at least that, right? At worst,

619
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,160
 your phone picking up where you're doing like hookups where you're cheating on your girlfriend or

620
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,520
 having, you know, love affairs, you're in Sri Lanka once a year and your phone's picking that up and

621
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,600
 you're just doing some awful stuff. And you're posting stuff on TikTok, like not even just the

622
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:05,040
 cringe stuff, but like the creepy stuff. All that stuff gets correlated, all that stuff gets processed

623
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,800
 and it just sits there. You think it's gone, you've forgotten about it. But when you get up to a

624
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:15,840
 certain level of prominence, it all comes back. So Creole Cosmopolitan, conspiracy theory, that

625
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,880
 could be true, right? It could just be, could just be hosting all of this information waiting for the

626
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,640
 optimal time. But again, with our conspiracy cap on, that I'm talking about information as a whole,

627
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,960
 Creole Cosmopolitan specified TikTok. So let's take it one step further and we're going to wrap it

628
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,760
 up like this, our extra long episode. Even though I'm sick and it should have been half the length

629
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,120
 it is. I wanted to tell you guys all these stories. I don't want to leave you guys waiting.

630
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:46,320
 Picture this. I read this gossip, the celebrity gossip website all the time called Alt Celebrities

631
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:53,520
 Gossip. It's basically if the daily, the Daily Mail or the Daily Mirror had no editors. That's

632
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,720
 what it is. It's just people sending in rumors. But rumors are very fascinating, right? The difference

633
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,680
 between a rumor and a conspiracy theory is very thin. And so I read this stuff. It's one of the

634
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,520
 things I kind of read before I go to bed. I find it super interesting. Is it true? Who knows? But

635
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,400
 one of the things that popped up the other day, it always sounds true, right? A good rumor always

636
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:19,200
 sounds true. This is what popped up the other day. Apparently there's a high level. And when I say

637
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,000
 high level, the, their thinking on this website, they were guessing it was either Jeff Bezos or

638
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,200
 Bill Gates is the one responsible for this. But they said, one of the wealthiest cheaters in the

639
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:35,200
 world, this very, very high level prominent person, had gotten into a bit of an issue recently,

640
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:41,040
 where they were sleeping around with this woman and she was about to expose it to the world.

641
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:48,640
 And their response to this blackmailing attempt was to invite the woman over to this

642
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:56,880
 office, over to this location and show them a video, a video of her having sex.

643
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,960
 And she's watching this video and she goes, that's not me.

644
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,400
 And they explained, yeah, that's not you. This is what we call a deep fake.

645
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,240
 This is another point scene. We got this other actress to have sex with this dude.

646
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,440
 But that's your face, right? Because that's what a deep fake is. We can take your image. We can take

647
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,720
 your face and perfectly match it onto this other woman's face or man, if you wanted to get really

648
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,560
 funky in the sex scene. I mean, I think people would be able to figure out it was fake then.

649
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,920
 But they go, look at this. Here is your face on this woman's body. The body looks similar to

650
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,920
 yours. We hire an actress who looks similar to you. This is your face. We're going to release

651
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,240
 this on all major porn sites with your real name, unless you drop this whole blackmail nonsense.

652
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,200
 So she dropped it. And I think this is where, whether or not that story is true, it could just

653
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:53,760
 be a gossip, obviously. But that's where I think TikTok would excel in is when you do a deep fake,

654
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,560
 you need to have like the more facial, like clear facial pictures you have of the person you're

655
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,560
 trying to fake the better. Because what it's all this computer learning. And if you have like a

656
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,280
 thousand still shots of someone's face, it'll look pretty good when you put it on the body. But if

657
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:16,240
 you have 10,000, not 10,000 pieces of video, but 10,000 individual shots. So in a, you can shoot

658
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,840
 a one minute TikTok showing your face, that's going to give you already hundreds of freeze

659
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:26,640
 framed shots of your face. And if you have a TikTok account, you're posting these videos all the time,

660
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,520
 they could easily edit you into a deep fake if you're constantly putting out these TikTok videos.

661
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,720
 So is it possible that the reason why TikTok could be so damaging is we are pumping out tons

662
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,440
 of videos of ourselves, most of it is the people's faces. They're talking directly to the camera,

663
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,360
 the camera is your phone, so it's fairly close to you. And when you pump out dozens of hours of

664
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:53,360
 TikToks, you can easily be deep faked into anything, anything. You couldn't do the same thing with

665
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,160
 Instagram, you couldn't do the same thing with Facebook, you definitely couldn't do the same

666
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:06,160
 thing with Gmail. But TikTok, you give yourself so much facial footage, that it's so easy to put

667
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,760
 over a porn star's head and blackmail you that way. So every time you make a TikTok, you're

668
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,920
 basically giving more information to the algorithm on not only how to blackmail you, but how to

669
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,240
 imitate you. And then taking it one final step forward to a true horrific vision of the future.

670
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:30,400
 If it has all your information, if the algorithm knows all of your wants, all of your hates,

671
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:38,000
 the places you go, the people you email, how you talk. And now it has all this facial footage of you,

672
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,920
 images of your body as you're doing all this TikTok stuff, how you move.

673
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:52,960
 Very, very easy to create a version of you, a virtual you. Again, if you just have the

674
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,760
 social networking stuff, it's all of your thoughts and your speech patterns, typing,

675
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,520
 writing patterns. But with TikTok added to that, it's also your image, the way your face moves

676
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,440
 when you're sad and you're happy, the way your body moves and you're doing the floss,

677
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,960
 all of that stuff. And it never goes away. So what happens when you have to start building virtual

678
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,840
 people? It scoops up all this information and now it can create you as an NPC in a video game.

679
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:25,600
 Because now it has all this information about you. There's a video game, there's a GT86,

680
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:31,040
 and they need to have a guy who's constantly going to Taco Bell. They could base it, they're like,

681
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,400
 well, here's a dude who always goes to Taco Bell. Here's his face on TikTok. And here's all of

682
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,240
 his information. We're going to input it in a Grand Theft Auto and it's going to walk around as he

683
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,880
 would, as he would. And you might think that's super fantastical. That is something that Arthur C.

684
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,120
 Clark would come up with. And it would be, right? That would be super fantastical. Probably should

685
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,520
 in this episode, 20 minutes. I'm sweating, I'm sweating so much. I'm trying to figure out a way

686
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,880
 to end this. But it would be super fantastical. It's probably too fantastical to go into very,

687
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,920
 very quickly. But the way I think of it is you can either program this type of stuff from the

688
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,760
 ground up. If you're a video game developer or you're trying to do a crowd scene for a movie,

689
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,440
 you could figure, and you're trying to do a CGI crowd scene for a movie, you could individually

690
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:24,720
 program all these parameters. But I believe technology will get to the point where you can

691
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,040
 have incredibly realistic NPCs in video games. So they're walking on the street and they'll drop

692
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,280
 something and they'll go down and pick it up and it wasn't scripted. That's just what you do. That's

693
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,320
 just what, I mean, you could get all this information because the information is there to buy. These

694
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,960
 video game companies could say, we want to buy thousands of people's of information from the

695
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:49,440
 social media networks and from TikTok and you program this in and see how they interact in an AI

696
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,320
 environment because we already have the personality there. It's already broken down into ones and

697
00:42:54,320 --> 00:43:00,960
 zeros, right? And we don't read the user agreements for any of this stuff. I'm sure that I'm not saying

698
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,640
 that if you look at the Facebook user agreement, it says, I agree to be turned into a video game

699
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,560
 character, but I'm sure that there are things in there saying the information I post no longer

700
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:16,640
 belongs to me. So they can sell it. So basically what I'm trying to say is as we're interacting with

701
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,200
 this internet, as we're leaving all of our information, leaving all of our digital footprints

702
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,760
 around, we may be setting ourselves up to be blackmailed in the future, but the future may be

703
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,800
 more horrifying than that. They may be creating virtual representations of us and they have all

704
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,400
 the information they need to create a virtual adjacent carpenter. It's all out there. Why they

705
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,680
 would want to, I don't know, but it's all out there. And if you were going to create a video

706
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,560
 game, if you're going to create a digital world and you wanted the audience to or the people in the

707
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:53,040
 video game to act realistically, you can just plug in all this information into the game and

708
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,160
 they'll start acting like that. It's a little more complicated than that, but you guys know what I

709
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:04,000
 mean. From a sci-fi level, the technology may not be there today, but you have hyper realistic

710
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,680
 NPCs or hyper realistic crowds in these movies that you want to have just background characters.

711
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,720
 And so is this what I'm getting at? This is what I'm getting at in my disease, the state of mind.

712
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:23,680
 Is that you? Have you now created such a perfect replica of you that you are now in that video

713
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:28,960
 game? Like you would wake up and you would be on the streets of GTA 6 or 9 or 13 or whatever it is.

714
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,200
 Because it's everything about you. The way your face kind of scrunches up when someone mentions

715
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:44,560
 the name Arthur C. Clarke. Ew. The way that you walk, the way that your shoe always seems to drag,

716
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,600
 the way that your left shoe always seems to drag across the ground when you're walking,

717
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:55,520
 the even the little things. At what point is that you? It's a perfect digital representation of you.

718
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:02,320
 And it thinks that it's you. And at that point we're getting into the whole simulation theory,

719
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:08,000
 that we may be living in a whole simulation, but it may not be that grandiose. We may live in a world

720
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,960
 where our own simulations are existing in video games alongside with us and we don't even know

721
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,520
 what our information was sold, chopped up and processed. And I may never know I'm an NPC

722
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:23,600
 in a video game or I'm sitting there in a crowd as Hawkeyes shooting arrows into some dude's skull.

723
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:29,280
 I'm like, go get him Hawkeye. At what point does that digital representation become us?

724
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:36,160
 At what point does that digital representation stop being a set of our personality traits and

725
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:44,880
 actually be us? So we could be living our life here, walking around while another version of us

726
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:50,480
 is constantly getting shot in the back of the head by some player on Xbox. Really makes you ask

727
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,320
 the question, who are we? Like, what defines us? Because it really is our personality and the way

728
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:01,840
 we interact with things, but if you can perfectly replicate that and you can do without my knowledge,

729
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:08,080
 because I signed some terms of agreement so I could use these free services.

730
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:17,680
 And now I'm a NPC in the metaverse. Who is the real Jason?

731
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,560
 Now you could say it's the dude who signed the terms of conditions. It was the dude who was born

732
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:30,640
 to his parents living on the earth. Yeah, but this body will be gone someday. The virtual Jason,

733
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:36,720
 all this information will live on long past me. Be NPCs in video games and all of this stuff.

734
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:45,280
 So at that point, who's the real Jason? Is it the memory of the cremated body in the urn?

735
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:54,560
 Or is it the Jason that continues to move through cyberspace, not even knowing that he's nothing but

736
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:05,280
 a computer program? And this all happened because I downloaded TikTok. I downloaded an app on my phone

737
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,000
 and gave them even more information to create a perfect representation of me. And again,

738
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 you could always say why would they want to create a representation of you or of me or of anybody?

739
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,080
 And that's always the question. But I always ask why are they providing such amazing services for

740
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:24,320
 free? It's not just selling your information. That doesn't make sense anymore. You can buy

741
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:30,080
 that information anywhere. There's something else going on. Whether or not it's turning me into an

742
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:36,160
 NPC character or blackmailing me. It's something else beyond ad-y. It's something else beyond selling

743
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:42,480
 ads or selling my information. I do believe there is another reason behind services like

744
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,560
 Gmail and Hotmail giving out free email addresses and YouTube allowing you to host

745
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:55,200
 stuff for free in TikTok. There's another reason why they're doing that. What it is,

746
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:02,560
 I don't know. Is it sinister? I hope not. Because billions of people use these services.

747
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:08,480
 So whatever the reason is, I hope it's a good one.

748
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:19,120
 But history has taught us that it probably isn't right. It probably isn't.

749
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:32,960
 DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is going to be your email address. You can also do so up at

750
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:39,040
 facebook.com/DeadRabbitRadio. TikTok is at DeadRabbitRadio. DeadRabbitRadio is the

751
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,720
 daily paranormal conspiracy true crime podcast. You don't have to listen to it every day,

752
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:55,680
 but I'm glad you listened to it today. Have a great one guys.

753
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:12,320
 Bye.
