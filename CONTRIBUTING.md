# Contributing to The Fluffle Transcribes Dead Rabbit Radio

Thank you for your interest in contributing to The Fluffle Transcribes Dead Rabbit Radio! We are an open-source project organized by fans of the "Dead Rabbit Radio" podcast and members of The Fluffle fan/listener community. Our goal is to create accurate transcripts of all episodes of the podcast and make them available to listeners who prefer to read the content rather than listen to it.

To contribute to the project, please follow these guidelines:

1. Before submitting a transcript, please ensure that you have listened to the episode carefully and have transcribed it accurately.

2. All contributions must be licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license. By submitting a transcript, you agree to license it under this license.

3. You must also assign any and all rights in the transcript to The Fluffle Transcribes Dead Rabbit Radio. This means that you are giving the project permission to use and distribute the transcript under the terms of the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.

4. To submit a transcript, please fork the repository and create a new branch for your contribution. When you are finished, submit a pull request with your changes.

5. When submitting a pull request, please provide a clear and concise description of your changes and why they are necessary.

6. If you have any questions or concerns about contributing, please submit an issue on the GitHub repository. Please do not contact Jason Carpenter for support or to ask questions about the project.
